US,Pinot Blanc,87,15,J. Scott Cellars 2010 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"Tart to the edge of sour, this is made for hot weather drinking. Lemon, lime and sour orange fruit with plenty of acidity and a solid, clean, crisp finish.",2010
Argentina,Chardonnay,89,120,Bodega Catena Zapata 2012 White Bones Adrianna Chardonnay (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"Barrel-related aromas of caramel, popcorn and baked pear dominate the nose, while the palate brings notes of citrus zest, with lively minerality and cutting acidity. This chiseled Chardonnay tastes like tart nectarine, green apple and lime, while the finish is tight as a drum. Drink through 2022.",2012
US,Chardonnay,93,45,Sojourn 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),Virginie Boone,"Golden honey and apple aromas open the door to a fulsome, rounded and sensually textured vineyard-designate, with a fruity core laced in nutmeg. Medium bodied yet lush, it retains a lingering persistence of acidity that keeps it fresh and bright on the palate.",2014
US,Red Blend,88,11,Crushed 2010 Red (California),Jim Gordon,"Generous, fruity and ripe, this unpretentious red blend based on Syrah lets the pure fruit flavors carry it rather than laying on heavy oak flavors. It is medium-bodied, broad-textured, very juicy and delicious.",2010
Austria,Grüner Veltliner,92,45,Hirsch 2013 Renner Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Yellow plum and mineral hints of wet pebble with an almost salty draw demand attention. The palate is fresh and full of appetizing, lemony zing and concentration. This is fun and satisfying, not to say completely delicious.",2013
US,Chardonnay,91,60,Brewer-Clifton 2012 Hapgood Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),Matt Kettmann,"Initial wafts of cannabis-like herbs quickly emerge into lime pith, limestone, struck match and oyster shells, with white flowers and yeastiness showing as well. There's a vivid tension between tart apple flesh and citrus pith on the palate, with lemon curd and pineapple elements arriving over time. Sit on this until 2017 so the acid can mellow, then drink through 2027.",2012
Portugal,Rosé,86,NA,José Maria da Fonseca 2014 Colecção Privada Roxo Rosé (Península de Setúbal),Roger Voss,"A light, bright and fresh wine, the epitome of a fruity rosé, this is made from Moscatel Roxo, a pink-skinned grape. It has plenty of lively acidity, a lightly perfumed character and a final burst of red fruits.",2014
Italy,Sauvignon,87,30,Alois Lageder 2014 Lehen Sauvignon (Alto Adige),Kerin O’Keefe,"The nose isn't overly expressive but eventually reveals suggestions of tropical fruit, chopped herb and a whiff of stone. The straightforward, slender palate offers grapefruit, a hint of peach and mineral accompanied by crisp acidity.",2014
Germany,Riesling,90,20,Von Schleinitz 2016 Nitor Dry Riesling (Mosel),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Plump apricot, melon and white peach abound are luscious. Yet it's dry in style and bracing too, edged by taut acidity and a steely, mineral edge. Accessible and elegantly balanced, its a four-square wine with excellent value.",2016
Italy,Schiava,89,17,St. Pauls 2013 Missianer Vernatsch Schiava (Alto Adige),Kerin O’Keefe,"Intense aromas of red cherry and wildflower open this bright, elegant red. The easy-drinking palate offers crushed cherry, strawberry, orange zest and a hint of white almond alongside refreshing acidity and ultrafine tannins.",2013
South Africa,Chardonnay,89,20,Buitenverwachting 2015 Bayten Chardonnay (Constantia),Lauren Buzzeo,"This is quite oaky upfront, with bold scents of baked apple, toasted hazelnut and vanilla bean. The palate offers more of the same, in addition to a bright yet decadent lemon-custard flavor. Honey-drizzled apple pie comes to the fore on the finish, with just enough acidity to keep the opulence in check.",2015
Italy,Pinot Nero,88,42,Majolini NV Altera Rosé Pinot Nero (Franciacorta),Kerin O’Keefe,"Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this opens with aromas of rose, McIntosh apple and red berry. The palate offers up raspberry, cranberry, nectarine and candied ginger backed up by brisk acidity. It ends on a walnut note.",NA
Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,84,12,Root:1 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),Michael Schachner,"Pungent up front, with green herb, white pepper and citrus aromas, this is zesty and acidic on the palate, with a monotonous lemon flavor on the finish. It turns more tart and acidic as it airs.",2012
Italy,Sangiovese,92,80,Celestino Pecci 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,Kerin O’Keefe,"Grilled herb, forest floor, ripe plum and leather aromas take shape in the glass. The brawny concentrated palate doles out ripe dark berry, tobacco, licorice and a hint of orange zest while firm, velvety tannins give the finish texture and grip. Drink 2020–2030.",2012
US,Rhône-style Red Blend,90,42,Alder Springs 2012 Kinesis Red (Mendocino),Jim Gordon,"Lots of sweet berry flavors and equally large doses of fine-grained tannins are the opposite poles in this full-bodied blend. It smells like boysenberry and blackberry jam, with similar fruit notes on the palate. Then very firm tannins kick in, making the texture at once blanketing and a bit drying. This has so much flavor that time in the bottle will tame some of those tannins and leave plenty of character to enjoy. Best after 2019.",2012
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,94,85,Hunnicutt 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),NA,"One sip is all it takes to delight. This wine screams Napa Cabernet with every nuance. Few wines achieve this richness of fruit and tannins. It floods the mouth with blackberry jam, chocolate and cassis liqueur flavors, wrapped into firm but supple tannins, and brightened with a squirt of citrusy acidity. Beautiful now, and should develop over the next decade.",2009
US,Zinfandel,93,34,Summers 2009 Four-Acre Zinfandel (Calistoga),NA,"Rich, blood warming and heady, this has vast and complex flavors of blackberry jam, licorice, bacon, spice and sweet, smoky sandalwood. It's hard to imagine a better wine to drink with barbecue.",2009
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,42,Sineann 2005 Baby Poux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"If anyone can perfectly evoke the ripe style of California Cabernet along with the structure of Washington state fruit, it's Peter Rosback of Sineann – conveniently located in Oregon. Why this iconoclastic winemaker does not just move to Washington is hard to figure; he obviously loves the grapes and knows exactly what to do with them. This Cabernet Sauvignon, from a relatively young block at the Champoux vineyard, has some heat and chewy tannins. But it should age well, and the tightly wound herb and tobacco and stone flavors that are now constrained will ultimately come out.",2005
Italy,Nebbiolo,93,90,Rivetti Massimo 2012 Serraboella  (Barbaresco),Kerin O’Keefe,"Ripe dark berry, sweet cake spice and pipe tobacco are just some of the aromas you'll find on this stunning wine. The palate shows structure and finesse, doling out black cherry, raspberry, black pepper, clove and anise alongside firm, velvety tannins and bright acidity.",2012
Italy,Nebbiolo,86,40,Arbéta 2012 Basarin  (Barbaresco),Kerin O’Keefe,"After a few swirls of the glass, you'll find subdued aromas recalling porcini mushroom, forest floor, camphor and a whiff of cellar floor. The lean palate offers raw sour cherry, espresso and a hint of coconut alongside raspy tannins that grip the mouth-drying finish.",2012
Australia,Shiraz-Grenache,91,20,D'Arenberg 2013 d'Arry's Original Shiraz-Grenache (McLaren Vale),Joe Czerwinski,"This 50-50 blend is firm, focused and rich, offering attractive aromas of mint, vanilla, cedar and red-skinned plums. Flavors turn darker, suggesting espresso and chocolate, but enlivened by bright acids. A wine worth holding a few years, priced at $20? Buy now, drink after 2020.",2013
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89,NA,Château Mouton Rothschild 2010 Le Petit Mouton  (Pauillac),Roger Voss,"This is a soft wine, dense and ripe. Any tannins are covered by sweet blackberry fruit flavors. This has attractive spice, final juiciness and bright acidity. A wine for early drinking.",2010
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,88,28,Chatter Creek 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"This is drinking very well; there's a little Merlot and Petit Verdot too in the blend. It's plummy and open, a little loose-knit in the core but soft and approachable. Wrapped into the tart fruit are streaks of licorice and tar, with light loamy tannins.",2006
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,89,70,Caymus 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),NA,Creamy black cherry aromas layered with fresh brussel sprouts and spicy arugula flavors of red plums and toasted oak.,1998
Argentina,Sémillon,80,15,Ricardo Santos 2009 Sémillon (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"Heavily vegetal and unclean on the nose, then pickled on the palate, as in sauerkraut. The only thing saving this from the flusher is decent body weight and mouthfeel.",2009
Italy,Cabernet Sauvignon,91,45,Castellare di Castellina 2005 Coniale Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana),NA,"Sweet oak notes are followed by cherry, chocolate and vanilla. This is a rich Cabernet Sauvignon with a modern and very pleasurable approach that puts emphasis on power, softness and intensity. Vibrant cherry flavors last many long minutes on the palate.",2005
US,Sauvignon Blanc,86,13,Layer Cake 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (California),Jim Gordon,"An herbal, earthy aroma is followed by crisp fruit flavors in this medium-bodied wine. It's tart and tangy on the palate, those leafy, green notes persisting through the finish.",2015
Italy,Nebbiolo,88,50,Aurelio Settimo 2013 Rocche dell'Annunziata  (Barolo),Kerin O’Keefe,"You'll find earthy aromas of used leather, game and a slight whiff of barnyard on this soulful red. The funky aromas follow over to the palate along with fleshy black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and a note of salted game. The rounded tannins are rather forward for such a young Barolo. Drink 2019–2025.",2013
France,Chardonnay,90,33,Domaine Guillemot-Michel 2008 Quintaine  (Mâcon-Villages),Roger Voss,"This 16–acre estate is run biodynamically, producing intensely flavored, honeyed, ripe wines. This is succulent from ripe fruit, with the acidity bright and vivid, finishing with sweet pineapple and apricot flavors.",2008
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92,NA,Château de Pez 2010 Barrel sample  (Saint-Estèphe),Roger Voss,"91-93 Powerfully tannic wine, the dryness balanced with sumptuous fruit. The wine shows balance, although the tannins are a major element.",2010
Hungary,Irsai Oliver,87,13,Szoke Matyás 2011 Irsai Oliver (Mátra),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Intense notes of white flower and lemon peel perfume this lovely aromatic white. Dry on the palate, with tart tangerine and lime flavors, it is marked by hints of blossom and zesty lime pith. Crisp and tonic on the finish. Drink now.",2011
US,Cabernet Franc,89,65,St. Supéry 2013 Estate Cabernet Franc (Rutherford),Virginie Boone,"Cedar dust, dried herb, currant and graphite combine effortlessly in this restrained wine, subtle in buried tannin. It shows voluptuous body with moderate acidity and a ripeness on the finish.",2013
US,Merlot,90,20,Maddalena 2010 Merlot (Paso Robles),Matt Kettmann,"This very fairly priced wine from the fourth-generation winemaking family behind San Antonio Winery delivers aromas of black cherry-crusted charred meats with significant mint character. It's dense on the palate and quite tannic, but quite nice with blackberry paste, licorice and tanned leather flavors.",2010
US,Roussanne,88,23,Forgeron 2008 Roussanne (Columbia Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"This is a firm, tart and tangy white wine with gooseberry, white peach and some green papaya all reflecting a rather cool, high-acid vintage. Refreshing and crisply structured, it's quite suitable for mellow cheeses and seafoods.",2008
Chile,Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon,83,NA,TerraNoble 2006 Lahuen Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),Michael Schachner,"Fairly hot and aggressive, with salinic, green aromas along with peppery fruit and coffee. The palate is kind of sharp and underwhelming, with green-infused plum and berry flavors. And the tomato leaf element on the finish leaves you wondering about ripeness. A mix of Carmenère and Cabernet Sauvignon.",2006
US,Pinot Noir,90,55,Fess Parker 2013 Older Barrels Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Matt Kettmann,"Dark strawberry fruit meets with rustic earthy aromas and light allspice notes on the nose of this wine from the late actor's family-owned winery. The palate shows boisterous and tart cranberry and black raspberry fruit, with pencil lead minerality and great energy, if not a ton of complexity.",2013
US,Riesling,87,24,Lamoreaux Landing 2015 Red Oak Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),Anna Lee C. Iijima,Pristine lime zest and lemon notes add lift to rounded apple and nectarine flavors on the palate of this full-bodied richly textured Riesling. There's a weightiness on the midpalate but the finish is refreshing and crisp.,2015
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93,NA,Château Brane-Cantenac 2010 Barrel sample  (Margaux),Roger Voss,"92-94 New, polished wood aromas lead to a wine that has a smooth balance between toast, sweet fruits and a velvet-textured acidity. Delicious.",2010
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89,NA,Château Siran 2012  Margaux,Roger Voss,"From the southern reaches of Margaux, this is already a velvet-textured wine with delicious black currant fruits and a touch of wood that is still showing. It will mature quickly and enjoyably, so drink from 2017.",2012
France,Gewürztraminer,87,19,Dopff & Irion 2009 Gewürztraminer (Alsace),Roger Voss,"For a Gewürz, this is restrained, a soft, open and attractively easy wine, lightly hinting at lychee and pear juice. Drink now.",2009
US,Red Blend,88,24,Serenity 2012 Mirth Red (Finger Lakes),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Equal proportions of Cabernet Franc and Merlot yield this penetrating sour-cherry palate touched with nuts, smoke, bramble and herb. It's refreshingly light bodied, marked by a crush of cranberry acidity and finely grained tannins.",2012
US,Riesling,89,14,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2014 Riesling (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"This is a medium-sweet Riesling boasting Spätlese-level alcohol, that mixes soft fruit flavors of apple, peach and pear with hints of honey and tea. Give it a light chill before sipping.",2014
US,Pinot Noir,88,28,Elk Cove 1998 Windhill Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Michael Schachner,"Smells like a briar patch under summer sun, with accents of leather and tomato. The pungent aromatics fade into a weighty mouthfeel. It’s all red berries, and it’s tight and young. Shows fine structure and a pure quality. A very likable wine.",1998
US,Gewürztraminer,88,14,Tsillan 2013 Estate Gewürztraminer (Lake Chelan),Sean P. Sullivan,"The Lake Chelan appellation shows promise for white wines and this is just another example. It brings notes of rose water, spice and mandarin orange, drinking off dry, with a zip of acidity. Pair it with a spicy Thai dish.",2013
Chile,Chardonnay,83,12,Chilcas 2013 Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),Michael Schachner,"Blatant aromas of popcorn don't allow for much fruit expression on the nose. This is heavy and lacking in vitality. Flavors of toast, burnt wood, barrel resin and tropical fruits finish soft.",2013
Italy,Sangiovese,92,55,Castello Romitorio 1997  Brunello di Montalcino,Roger Voss,"Sandro Chia's winery is known not only for its reliable and enjoyable wines, but also for the art series labels—work from his New York and Montalcino studios—for each vintage. In 1997, the estate has produced an intense wine, skillfully managing the sweet wood and rich, dark and concentrated fruit. The wine will age well—coming to maturity in 10 years or more—but will surely be drinkable in five.",1997
US,Grenache,94,36,Nelle 2014 Grenache (California),Matt Kettmann,"Intriguing layers of fruit and herbs interplay on the delicious nose of this bottling, showing bay leaf, thyme, oregano, pepper, hibiscus and cherry. The palate is rich and savory, with more of the same roasting herbs as well as fig, black olive, black pepper, fennel and purple-flower flavors. It's quite rich and delicious.",2014
France,Pinot Noir,87,20,Domaines Tatin 2014 Les Demoiselles Tatin Pinot Noir (Reuilly),Roger Voss,"Smooth and soft, this has light, fresh red-berry fruits laced with acidity and perfumed by red cherries.

South Africa,Pinotage,86,10,Golden Kaan 2006 Pinotage (Western Cape),Susan Kostrzewa,"Savory cherry, raspberry and plum aromas in this approachable Pinotage lead into spicy, savory flavors of cherry, plum and smoke. It's an accessible version of a variety that can be tough for some to embrace. Pair with pork or spicy dishes.",2006
France,Sauvignon Blanc,84,16,Simonnet-Febvre 2012  Saint-Bris,Roger Voss,"A soft, fruity wine, this features attractive citrus and peach flavors. It's light and fresh with a crisp, bright aftertaste. Saint-Bris is the only appellation in Burgundy to produce Sauvignon Blanc.",2012
US,Petite Sirah,91,25,Chacewater 2013 Petite Sirah (Lake County),Jim Gordon,"This is a full-bore, concentrated and tannic wine that lives up to the reputation of a not exactly “petite” varietal.

France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93,50,Château Canon la Gaffelière 2000  Saint-Émilion,Roger Voss,"This is the flagship wine from the mini-empire (now comprising five properties) that is controlled by Comte Stephan von Niepperg. He has made a modern, wood dominated wine, with rich, concentrated black fruits. It is powerful, perhaps too powerful, lacking a sense of the usual grace of this estate, although the ripeness of the wine does compensate.",2000
US,Rhône-style Red Blend,89,35,DaMa 2011 Damnation Lonesome Springs Vineyard Red (Washington),Sean P. Sullivan,"Despite its Washington-designated label, this blend of 45% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre all comes from Lonesome Springs Vineyard in the Yakima Valley. The aromas of coffee, cherry, red apple and peppery spices are generous, while the palate is full and creamy in feel, with the texture providing much of the appeal.",2011
US,Tempranillo,87,28,McCay Cellars 2013 Lot 13 Vineyard Tempranillo (Lodi),Jim Gordon,"Attractive white-pepper aromas and powerful dark-fruit flavors combine with firm tannins in this full-bodied wine. It is bold and a bit rustic, and should pair well with a juicy hamburger or rich lasagna.",2013

US,Pinot Grigio,85,10,Francis Ford Coppola 2007 Presents Bianco Pinot Grigio (California),NA,"Everybody needs a dry, tart white wine and Coppola has provided us with one in this crisply citric bottling. It's fresh and uplifting in grapefruit, lime and spicy flavors, at a good price.",2007
US,Red Blend,90,50,Château Élan 2013 Les Petits Red (America),Jim Gordon,"This dark, potent, full-bodied wine is made from two of the darkest, most tannic grape varieties—Petit Verdot and Petite Syrah—and there is nothing petite about this blend. Its color is almost black and opaque, while aromas and flavors suggest smoke, blueberry and espresso. The texture is tannic but not overbearing.",2013
Italy,Sangiovese Grosso,86,NA,Geografico Castello Tricerchi 2008  Rosso di Montalcino,NA,"Light and luminous in appearance, this bright Rosso di Montalcino delivers subdued aromas of raspberry, cherry, cola and wet earth. None of these aromas are particularly intense, but they are balanced.",2008
France,Red Blend,92,38,Clos Venturi 2015 Red (Corse),Roger Voss,"This impressive, ripe wine from the Venturi estate has fine, juicy black fruit flavors balanced by acidity and underlying firm tannins.

US,Chardonnay,92,50,Artesa 2013 Single Vineyard Block 92 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),Virginie Boone,"Voluptuously honeyed with swirls of caramel, this single-vineyard estate wine is expansive on the palate.

Spain,Graciano,90,140,Contino 2011  Rioja,Michael Schachner,"Bold oak on the nose places aromas of hickory and smoke atop sappy berry scents. A clampy tannic, high-energy palate is emboldened by penetrating acidity, while flavors of plum, berry, tomato and spice are lifted by that same acidity. This is still young, jagged and abrasive on the finish. Drink through 2028.",2011
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,91,125,Revival 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Virginie Boone,"This is a satisfying, small-production wine from four rows of the family's Kairos Vineyard, a study in sanguine intensity. Currant, cassis and tar integrate with the body of subtle oak and tannin, finishing in a sprinkling of dried herb and graphite.",2012
Chile,Carmenère,85,11,Viña Bisquertt 2007 Casa La Joya Reserve Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),Michael Schachner,"Meaty, rubbery aromas open it up, and it evolves into a dark, chunky, aggressive type of wine. The palate is big and round, with medium tannins and dark, slightly burnt flavors of blackberry and licorice. The finish shows coffee and extract, but not much length or refinement. Husky and ripe more than sleek and elevated.",2007
Italy,Sangiovese Grosso,94,59,La Fortuna 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),NA,"This riserva is silky, firm and polished, with bright fruit nuances of wild berry, almond skin, cola and lingering menthol overtones. The mouthfeel is bright and crisp, with a very fine, smooth texture. Dusty mineral notes appear on the finish.",2006
US,Sauvignon Blanc,91,15,Jones of Washington 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"Honeysuckle scents and ripe, fresh fruit flavors run from grapefruit on into tropical. This was fermented in Hungarian puncheons, picking up just a hint of toast along the way. Clean and quite delicious.",2010
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,83,10,Château Mayne Vieil 2015 Château Buisson Redon  (Bordeaux),Roger Voss,"Light and unfocused, this simple wine has fruit but misses out on structure and much interest.",2015
US,Sauvignon Blanc,87,18,Heritance 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Virginie Boone,"Kiwi, peach and pineapple mark this blend of 93% Sauvignon Blanc and 7% Sémillon, providing a tropical character and personality.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,88,NA,Santos & Seixo 2015 Santos da Casa Tinto Red (Alentejano),Roger Voss,"This ripe blend of four grapes was aged in wood for nine months. Filled by rich blackberry fruits, the generous texture is cut by acidity. Drink this smooth wine now.",2015
Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon,85,20,Terrazas de Los Andes 2012 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"Wiry, rugged aromas of cassis and blackberry are a bit green and pyrazinic. Chunky, tannic and sticky in feel, this tastes of baked black fruits. Stewy, syrupy and creamy on the finish, the wine gets better the longer it sits.",2012
US,Pinot Noir,87,85,Patz & Hall 2010 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),NA,"A strong, extracted Pinot, lacking delicacy and finesse. It's enormous in jammy raspberries, cherries and liqueur, with plenty of sweet, toasty oak. High alcohol gives it a full body and a taste of glyceriney sweetness. Many will like its power and flash. Drink it over the next few years.",2010
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,90,Cayuse 2013 The Widowmaker En Chamberlain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Sean P. Sullivan,"Expressive aromas of funk, ember, moist soil, truffle, olive and high-toned dried herbs are followed by a freshly elegant and flavor-focused palate.

Italy,Red Blend,88,30,Cantina Valpolicella Negrar 2012 La Tirela  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of baked plum, cake spice and a whiff of dried herb lead the way.

Italy,Barbera,89,NA,Castello di Razzano 2007 Del Beneficio  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),NA,"Thick, black and extracted, this dense Barbera d'Asti Superiore opens with intense aromas of black fruit and fresh oak.

Austria,Riesling,89,15,Winzer Krems 2016 Von Den Terrassen Riesling (Niederösterreich),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Tart red apple and lemon make for an inviting, appetizing nose.

There is a smoky smudge to the velvet tannins, making this intriguing and elegant. The tannic structure frames this medium-bodied charmer, and its superb balance and aromatic layers make you come back for more. Ready from 2016.",2011

The palate shows weight but a refined mouthfeel that's not sticky or heavy. Flavors of coffee, mocha, chocolate, caramel, peanut brittle and prune finish warm and long. Only 43 cases made.",1947
US,Sauvignon Blanc,84,22,Hauck 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),NA,"A bit on the sugary side, making it not truly dry, but adequate acidity provides balance to the very rich pineapple, pear, fig and honeysuckle flavors. Great with Vietnamese or Chinese fare.",2007
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,60,Parry Cellars 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),NA,"Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure.

Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,84,10,Terrapura 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),Michael Schachner,"Basically a clean, light, simple white with a flat/soft body and pithy, dry flavors of citrus and melon rind.

US,Cabernet Sauvignon,84,40,Terra Valentine 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),NA,"There's a vegetable aroma in this wine, not exactly herbs, more like asparagus. In the mouth, the Cab tastes soft, sweet and candied. Average at best, and not an ager.",2007
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,84,13,Château les Berthets 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,Roger Voss,"This is a lean wine, all tannins and missing fruit. It is dry and showing considerable hard extraction. It will soften, but not much.",2014

Iijima,"Wisps of smoke and toast accent fresh, juicy black cherries and berries in this unusual sparkling wine made from Teroldego grapes. The palate balances fresh, primary black-fruit flavors with warm hints of caramel and spice. The mousse is a mouth-filling blanket of thick, rich foam but dissipates into an elegant finish.",2011
Spain,Red Blend,89,32,Besllum 2008 Red (Montsant),Michael Schachner,"Robust on the bouquet, with ample red berry fruit and vanilla.

Spain,Tempranillo Blend,92,150,Contino 2009 Viña del Olivo  (Rioja),Michael Schachner,"Initial oaky aromas of dried cheese, coffee grinds, lemon peel and vanilla welcome in plum and other red-berry scents.

France,Provence red blend,94,44,Domaine de la Bégude 2013 La Bégude Red (Bandol),Roger Voss,"This is a wine that is beginning to show some fine maturity. There are ripe fruits still very present, but they are matched by the secondary flavors, spice and warm tannins along with the classic herbal character of Mourvèdre.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,87,13,Quinta da Ribeirinha 2015 Ardósia Tinto Red (Tejo),Roger Voss,"Made to drink young, this fruity, softly structured wine is ripe with blackberry fruits. There is a touch of spice from the wood aging and a lining of attractive acidity. Drink now.",2015
France,Gamay,88,30,Marcel Lapierre 2007  Morgon,Roger Voss,"From biodynamic producer Marcel Lapierre, this is probably as good as it got in 2007.

France,Riesling,86,NA,Boeckel 2010 Réserve Riesling (Alsace),Roger Voss,"This is a steely wine wrapped with white and green fruit flavors. It is clean, bright and full of pear and crisp apple notes. The tangy after taste is floral. Ready to drink in six months.",2010
France,Champagne Blend,90,NA,J. Dumangin Fils NV Extra Brut Premier Cru  (Champagne),Roger Voss,"Well on the dry side of brut, this wine pushes acidity and the freshest citrus along with an apple-skin texture. It shows some bottle age toastiness, while offering a delicious bright finish.",NA

US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93,300,Cardinale 2007 Red (Napa Valley),NA,"A darkly colored, tannic Cabernet whose dry astringency keeps it from being thoroughly enjoyable now.

Portugal,Portuguese White,88,20,Herdade das Servas 2016 Colheita Seleccionada White (Alentejano),Roger Voss,"This is a superripe wine, full of generous white and yellow stone fruits.

US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86,32,SuLei 2010 Les Collines Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent.

France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90,50,Château Tour des Gendres 2008 Moulin des Dames Red (Côtes de Bergerac),Roger Voss,"Hugely concentrated wine, full of new toasty wood flavors, its structure packed with tannins.

France,Rosé,84,15,Château de Lisennes 2016 7 Hectares Vin Bio Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),Roger Voss,This wine has a caramel edge that gives richness but also detracts from the fruit. It offers a smooth texture along with a spicy edge. Drink now.,2016
Portugal,Portuguese Red,95,100,Quinta do Vale Meão 2014 Red (Douro),Roger Voss,"The estate is owned by the Olazabal family, descendants of Antonia Ferreira who created this and many other estates in the 19th century. This is a major wine, ripe and full of rich tannins and concentrated fruit. It is always one of the longest-lived wines from the Douro and this vintage has the structure and the fruit weight to develop well. An attractive spicy, smoky character adds extra interest.

Australia,G-S-M,90,65,D'Arenberg 2005 The Ironstone Pressings G-S-M (McLaren Vale),Joe Czerwinski,"This blend of 70% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 5% Mourvèdre features surprisingly dark fruit flavors akin to blackberries and cola. A hint of mint or eucalyptus enlivens the bouquet and helps to lighten this otherwise rather full-bodied, brooding wine. Finishes long, with enough dusty tannins to warrant cellaring through 2015.",2005
US,Chardonnay,87,20,J Wilkes 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),Matt Kettmann,"Apple custard, green apple peels and a bit of barrel warmth entertain the nose on this reasonably priced wine from a highly reliable appellation.

France,Rhône-style Red Blend,88,15,Domaine Cabirau 2011 Red (Côtes du Roussillon),Lauren Buzzeo,"Hints of earthy spice and bark add interest to the somewhat muted blackberry and black plum aromas.

US,Sagrantino,87,40,Wilridge 2015 Estate Wilridge Vineyard Sagrantino (Naches Heights),Sean P. Sullivan,"This is the only bottling of this variety I am aware of in the state. The aromas are intriguing: all high toned, with notes of herb, barrel spice and ripe blackberry. The flavors are full bore, holding nothing back. The tannins bring a slight sense of astringency. There's promise.",2015
Austria,Grüner Veltliner,93,40,Tegernseerhof 2008 Höhereck Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),Roger Voss,"Martin Mittelbach rolls out this intense, concentrated wine, which packs spice, ripe pineapple and apricots and a final floral character that fills the mouth. A wine to age for at least four years. Screwcap.",2008
Canada,Syrah,92,85,Le Vieux Pin 2011 Équinoxe Syrah (Okanagan Valley),Paul Gregutt,"Steely and compact, this rather reluctantly opens to reveal subtle complexity. The mix of tart blueberry and blackberry fruit is accompanied by scents of cured meat, menthol and garrigue. It spent 18 months in a mix of barrels and puncheons, yielding a pleasant finishing impression of cedar. Decant this for at least an hour or two.",2011
US,Chardonnay,87,35,Patz & Hall 2010 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),NA,"Oaky and seemingly sweet, this is a showy wine whose appeal comes from its ripeness and richness.

This offers deep cassis, mineral, and earth flavors, powerful and dense. The Seven Hills style, ordinarily restrained and elegant, suits this vineyard especially well, as it reins in the tendency of Klipsun fruit to go over the top, and become too tannic. This is muscular and deep, but proportionate and detailed.",2007
Italy,Falanghina,87,13,Gran Passione 2015 Falanghina (Beneventano),Kerin O’Keefe,"Fresh and zesty, this opens with aromas suggesting white spring flower, pear and exotic fruit. The tangy palate offers white peach, citrus and pineapple while a mineral note accents the finish.",2015
US,Pinot Gris,83,17,Hamlet 2012 Pinot Gris (Virginia),NA,"Soft scents of dryer sheets, lemons, tropical fruits and white flowers mark this Pinot Gris. On entrance, this light-to medium-bodied wine feels loose and flat, but the acidity picks up on the finish to give it a final lift.",2012

New Zealand,Pinot Noir,84,20,Opawa 2009 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),Joe Czerwinski,"On the light-bodied side of the Pinot Noir spectrum, with modest red-fruit aromas and flavors accented by some funky, oaky notes of tree bark and charred nuts.",2009

With a nod to the Old World, it's lean and savory in black tea and exotic herb. Juicy, brambly berry come to the fore on the finish, which is still grippy on the palate.",2011
Italy,Pinot Grigio,89,28,Lis Neris 2009 Gris Pinot Grigio (Friuli Isonzo),NA,"Gris Pinot Grigio Gris offers a sultry, sophisticated side to what is normally perceived as an easy-drinking white wine variety.

Drink 2015–2020.",2010
US,Merlot,85,22,Deep Sea 2011 The Octopus Merlot (Paso Robles),Matt Kettmann,"This has a reductive nose, with stewed blackberry giving a fruity side to the barnyard-y aromas. The flavors are earthy and savory, with some cigar box surrounding it all, but not tons of fruit.",2011
Italy,Sangiovese Grosso,90,80,Il Poggiolo E. Cosimi 2006 Poggiolo  (Brunello di Montalcino),NA,"Buoyant cola and root beer aromas frame solid aromas of almond paste and wild berry. This Brunello shows a smooth, rich mouthfeel with tight, compact tannins on the close.",2006
US,Pinot Noir,90,38,Wrath 2013 Ex Vite Pinot Noir (Monterey),Matt Kettmann,"Meaning “from the vine,” this 100% whole-cluster bottling presents black cherry, tart pomegranate, graphite, baking spice and sage bark on the nose. There's lots of dark herbs and dark fruit on the palate as well as black-olive depth and black-slate minerality. With the density of herbs, it's a bit like chewing on sage and eucalyptus.",2013
US,Zinfandel,93,40,V. Sattui 2008 Black-Sears Vineyard Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),NA,"The vineyard has been source of good Zinfandel for V. Sattui, and this is their best yet. The wine is enormously rich and ripe in berry, cherry, currant, mocha and pepper flavors, but its structure really warrants attention. Perfectly firm tannins, fine acidity, and a touch of minerality gives the wine grounding. The alcohol is high, but in keeping with the wine's expression.",2008
Portugal,Portuguese Red,89,NA,Quinta da Romaneira 2011 Sino da Romaneira Red (Douro),Roger Voss,"The third wine of Quinta da Romaneira is made to be drunk young.

Drink now.",2011
Portugal,Portuguese White,87,24,Casca Wines 2008 Monte Cascas Reserva White (Minho),Roger Voss,"Lemon grass, lime and intensely crisp acidity identify the wine as definitely from the cool north of Portugal. A strong apple-skin texture dominates, leaving a wine that really needs shellfish type foods.",2008
France,Pinot Gris,93,26,Domaine Michel Fonne 2010 Marckrain Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),Anne Krebiehl MW,"There is not just a notion of ripeness but almost of overripeness of pear fruit on the nose, accompanied by hints of honeysuckle. There also are hints of sandalwood and gentle vanilla. The palate is cushioned with mellow residual sweetness, making the rich flavors even more rich and generous. A vein of citrus freshness counters this, but this is in the generous, medium-sweet spectrum, oozing fruit and generosity. The finish, nonetheless, is precise and fresh. A great example of mature Pinot Gris.",2010
US,Chardonnay,86,17,Dalliance 2013 Chardonnay (Lake County),Jim Gordon,"This is a very good, crowd-pleasing Chardonnay with lots of ripe, fresh fruit flavors and tasty accents of vanilla and butter. It is medium-bodied, soft and smooth in texture, leans toward sweetness and has a lingering, fruity finish.",2013
US,Riesling,88,17,Shady Lane 2013 Estate Dry Riesling (Leelanau Peninsula),Alexander Peartree,"From the lightly nutty almond-skin aroma, to the creamy palate and savory finish, it's apparent that the winemaker enjoys experimenting with lees contact to help broaden the midpalate. While this application might seem a little aggressive to some, there's a lovely balance of juicy red apple and streamlined, focused quince to appeal to a broader audience.",2013
France,Rhône-style Red Blend,90,NA,Domaine du Gros Nore 2011 Red (Bandol),Roger Voss,This wine has intense acidity and a profoundly mineral character. Rich black-fruit flavors and firm tannins give it a sense of potential for the future. Drink from 2016.,2011

Portugal,Port,96,415,Burmester 1952 Colheita Tawny  (Port),Roger Voss,"This is an astonishing wine for its age. It shines with fruit and with rich toffee flavors that are balanced by acidity. It's a warm, ripe wine, intense and concentrated. The dryness of such a long wood aging (the wine was only bottled in 2015) is really only a background to the richness.",1952
Serbia,Tamjanika,88,18,Budimir 2013 Župska Tamjanika (Župa),Jeff Jenssen,"This 100% Tamjanika from Serbia has gooseberry, mango and white flowers leading the nose. Following that, it is soft on entry with flavors of pronounced florality, white peach and yellow peach.",2013
US,Merlot,91,20,Buena Vista 2009 Merlot (Carneros),NA,"A distinguished Merlot, dark, dry and brooding. Complex, too, with deep flavors of blueberry, mushroom, dark chocolate and anise.

US,Pinot Noir,90,48,Sanglier Cellars 2012 Old Camp Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Jim Gordon,"Ripe and fruity, rich and generous, almost soft in texture, this starts with strawberry-syrup aromas, then tastes like sweet red cherries with light spicy oak accents.

US,Sauvignon Blanc,90,18,Voss 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),NA,"A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc, dry and crisp and low in alcohol. With no oak to interfere, it shows vibrant citrus fruit, guava, lemongrass and mineral flavors, balanced with zesty acidity. A beautiful, racy wine.",2009
US,Petite Sirah,85,30,Fernwood 2007 Machado Creek Vineyards Petite Sirah (Central Coast),NA,"Tons of upfront fruity flavor mark this crisp, tannic wine. It's almost sweet in jammy cherries and blackberries, with a smoked meat edge of bacon and caramelized notes from oak. Could be drier and have greater structure and complexity.

US,Viognier,88,17,Tangent 2014 Paragon Vineyard Viognier (Edna Valley),Matt Kettmann,"This region is known for producing lean whites from grapes that tend to be blousy in warmer zones, and this bottling is no exception.

France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93,110,Vieux Château Mazerat 2008  Saint-Émilion,Roger Voss,"Very intense wine, packed with dark tannins, solid and powerful. It is leavened with great perfumes, while the overall effect is dark, brooding and concentrated.",2008

The palate delivers black plum and tobacco flavors, bolstered by dusty tannins. Enjoy soon.",2014
France,Champagne Blend,94,125,Lanson NV Extra Age Brut Rosé  (Champagne),Roger Voss,"Extra Age in the name means just that. This wine has been given more time (5 years) in bottle before release. That results in a very fine wine, a blend of 2002, 2004 and 2005 that has more depth of flavor and richness as well as showing some bottle maturity. Like all Lanson wines, it is dry although this rosé also brings out crisp red currant fruits and tight acidity. It is ready to drink.",NA
Austria,Grüner Veltliner,92,NA,Kurt Angerer 2010 Loam Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),Roger Voss,"A rich and creamy wine, this is full of the ripest fruit.

US,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,68,Pride Mountain 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa-Sonoma),NA,"Shows Pride's house style, a wildly bold, mountain-concentrated wine that couldn't possibly be fruitier or riper. Intense flavors of blackberries, blueberries and cedar are wrapped into complex but gentle tannins, making the wine drinkable now. But it should develop over the next 6–8 years.",2009
US,Sauvignon Blanc,86,19,Matanzas Creek 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),NA,"Not quite up there with previous vintages, although they've held the price and that's a good thing.

US,Syrah,89,35,Atwater 2011 Syrah (Finger Lakes),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Tart red cherry and fresh herb lend a crisp, cool tone to this elegantly composed Syrah.

Austria,Gewürztraminer,87,18,Höpler 2003 Gewürztraminer (Burgenland),Roger Voss,"While it may not be as spicy as some Alsace Gewürztraminer, this definitely shows soft, lychee qualities to go with its soft texture and light acidity.

US,Red Blend,86,16,Old Soul 2014 Pure Red (California),Jim Gordon,"This soft and lightly spicy wine has big fruit flavors, a veneer of sweet oak and a plush texture. It's easy to smell and taste the ripe cherry and strawberry accents.",2014
US,Red Blend,91,36,Maryhill 2013 Proprietor's Reserve Rosso Granato Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is a blend of Art Den Hoed Petite Sirah (80%) and Gunkel Vineyard Zinfandel. Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, raspberry and purple fruit are followed by full-bodied palate-coating fruit flavors, brightened by fresh acidity. The interest is as much about feel as flavor.",2013
Italy,Nebbiolo,90,120,Domenico Clerico 2005 Percristina  (Barolo),Kerin O’Keefe,"Aged for 36 months in barriques and 24 months in large casks, this opens with aromas of coconut, toasted oak and spicy blackberry.

Australia,Shiraz,90,50,Gemtree 2004 Obsidian Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Joe Czerwinski,"Gemtree's Obsidian Shiraz ratchets up the intensity from its usual offerings, adding structure and richness to straight-ahead aromas and flavors of cherries, coffee and vanilla.

Austria,Riesling,91,29,Graf Hardegg 2015 Spätlese Riesling (Niederösterreich),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Honey and the perfumed notes of quince are immediately apparent on this Spätlese Riesling. The sweetness is carried beautifully by ripe notions of peach, additional quince and apricot coulis, balanced and countered by the fresh, ripe and pliable acidity of oranges and tangerines. This is slightly decadent and very harmonious. Perhaps sweet enough for an apricot tart but certainly a killer with salty blue cheeses. No other grape can perform the same tightrope walk as Riesling. Enjoy.",2015

Italy,Nebbiolo,92,NA,Cascina Ballarin 2006 Bricco Rocca  (Barolo),NA,"Barolo Bricco Rocca still needs a few more years in the cellar to allow for full integrations of its spice, fruit, tobacco and mineral components.

US,Syrah,93,50,Lucia 2012 Soberanes Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),Matt Kettmann,"Pulverized peppercorns and dried oregano aromas give ample seasoning to lush blackberry fruit on this wine from a vineyard planted by the Pisoni and Franscioni families.

France,Sparkling Blend,86,13,Bouvet-Ladubay NV Rosé Excellence Brut Sparkling (Vin Mousseux),Roger Voss,"Bouvet Ladubay's rosé is a soft in style with a light fruit flavor dominated by fresh raspberries.

Italy,Greco,88,24,Mastroberardino 2006 Nova Serra  (Greco di Tufo),NA,The nose here is truly beautiful and reminiscent of exotic fruit and delicate spring flowers. This is a nicely made wine with balanced aromas and a full but compact feel in the mouth that is crisp and approachable.,2006
US,Syrah,85,27,Baldassari Family Wines 2007 Nolan Vineyards Syrah (Bennett Valley),NA,"Soft, sweet in jammy raspberry and cherry fruit and caramelized oak, this Syrah is somewhat simple. It's good, but would benefit from greater structure.",2007
France,Riesling,90,26,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann 2012 Seppi Landmann Vallée Noble Riesling (Alsace),Roger Voss,"Produced in the Vallée Noble sub-region in Soultzmatt, this is ripe and powerfully rich. It is strongly perfumed, full of white fruit and very floral in character. A thread of minerality runs through this still-young wine giving structure. Drink from 2017.",2012
Italy,Garganega,84,12,Dal Cero Tenuta di Corte Giacobbe 2011 Corte Giacobbe  (Soave),NA,"Here's an easy and fresh white wine to drink with bruschetta or informal finger foods. The wine is crisp and light with endnotes of white peach, citrus and pear.",2011
France,Rhône-style White Blend,85,15,Louis Bernard 2014 White (Côtes du Rhône),Joe Czerwinski,"This medium-bodied white blend is simple, fruity and fresh, dominated by aromas and flavors of pear, pineapple and melon.",2014
Argentina,Pinot Gris,87,15,Domaine Bousquet 2015 Reserve Pinot Gris (Tupungato),Michael Schachner,"Despite looking gold and mature, this PG exceeds expectations courtesy of waxy, baked-apple aromas and a full but balanced mouthfeel. Spiced apple, apricot and burnt orange flavors finish long due to core acidity. Drink immediately.",2015
US,White Blend,92,25,DeLille 2000 Chaleur Estate White (Columbia Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"In this new vintage there is a bit more Sauvignon Blanc (69%) than usual; the rest is Sémillon. Rich, oaky and expansive, it is an oak and texture-driven style, with the fruit—clean, slightly herbaceous, spicy and tart—playing second fiddle. Which is no criticism, because the delicious, over-the-top flavors, with layer upon layer of creamy complexity, and the rich, buttery finish just beg for lobster in a cream or butter sauce. Who can argue with that? Editors' Choice.",2000
Italy,Sangiovese Grosso,92,NA,Podere La Vigna 2004 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),NA,"Here's a dark and brooding Brunello Riserva with modern tones of succulent fruit backed by sophisticated notes of spice, toast, chocolate and cola. This is definitely a bigger style with a bold and determined approach that also offers elegance and harmony.",2004
Chile,Pinot Noir,86,13,Quintay 2008 Clava Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),Michael Schachner,"Spunky and sweet smelling, with a touch of stemmy pepper to the nose. The palate is narrow but fruity, with your standard allotment of zesty red fruit flavors along with mellow spice. Finishes short, with drying tannins. Good but lacks nuance and sophistication.",2008
Australia,Shiraz,88,15,Petaluma 1999 Bridgewater Mill Shiraz (Australia),Joe Czerwinski,"Unlike many an Australian Shiraz, this one sees only French oak barrels for aging. The result is a dense, blueberry-filled wine, supported by hints of toast and espresso. It's full-bodied but not tiring to drink, thanks to an enlivening burst of black pepper on the finish. Best Buy. —J.C.",1999
Italy,Rosato,84,13,Santi 2016 Infinito  (Bardolino Chiaretto),Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of orange blossom and wild berry lead the way. The bright simple palate is on the slender side, offering suggestions of strawberry and cherry alongside vibrant acidity.",2016
US,Sauvignon Blanc,88,30,Westerly 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),Matt Kettmann,"Light notes of cut lemongrass and squeezed lemon show on the nose of this wine by former Harlan Estates cellar master Adam Henkel. Lime juice, wet cement and apple peels combine for a standard and straightforward flavor profile, which is clean, tight and packs a good acidic sizzle.",2014
France,Pinot Noir,92,NA,Domaine Delaporte 2014 Maxime Cuvée Silex  (Sancerre),Roger Voss,"While the wine is very young, the potential is there. It has rich tannins and berry fruits that are packed with youthful acidity. The structure and the depth of flavor are there with a hint of the juicy fruits as well as the minerality that are both developing. Drink from 2018.",2014
US,Merlot,84,38,Hunt Cellars 2004 Unforgettable Merlot (Paso Robles),NA,"Tastes candy sweet and hot, with Lifesaver cherry and black raspberry flavors. Drink now.",2004
US,Fumé Blanc,93,75,Robert Mondavi 2009 To Kalon Vineyard I-Block Fumé Blanc (Oakville),NA,"Another fabulous I Block from Mondavi. Exceptionally ripe in grapefruit, lime and gooseberry fruit, it shows the minerality of this vineyard that gives the wine grip and grounding. Bone-dry, with crisp supportive acidity and just the right amount of oak, it's wonderful now. This is not a wine to age, but will hold over the next four years.",2009
Italy,Red Blend,86,40,Il Cavalierino 2011  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Kerin O’Keefe,"Dense and one-dimensional, this opens with faint aromas of raisin, leather and a whiff of spice. The evolved palate offers stewed plum, a green note of unripe cherry, powdered sage and a hint of licorice. Raspy tannins create an abrupt, astringent finish.",2011
France,Chardonnay,86,NA,Pierre André 2010 Réserve  (Bourgogne),Roger Voss,"Soft and rounded, this has an attractive fresh-fruit character. It's warm with a yellow fruit flavor; a crisp touch of grapefruit tempers the richness.",2010
Italy,Nebbiolo,96,72,Proprietà Sperino 2011  Lessona,Kerin O’Keefe,"Tilled earth, underbrush, rose petal, perfumed berry, aromatic herb and a balsamic note are some of the many alluring scents you'll find on this gorgeous red. The juicy palate is both earthy and loaded with finesse, doling out ripe dark cherry, raspberry, pipe tobacco, licorice and energizing mineral. Firm, polished tannins provide structure. It's already almost accessible but will continue to evolve and age beautifully. Drink from 2019 through 2029.",2011
US,Pinot Noir,85,22,Anne Amie 2011 Cuvée A Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"This is a light, simple wine, mixing tart cranberry fruit with streaks of leaf and stem. The rather low alcohol and overall lightness makes it a good summer quaffing red.",2011
Italy,White Blend,90,30,Tasca d'Almerita 2007 Diamante 500ml White (Sicilia),NA,"Made with a blend of diverse aromatic grapes from Sicily and beyond, this golden Passito is redolent of candied orange, dried apricot, honey, almond marzipan and loads of sweet, raw honey. The wine is dense and creamy and extremely sweet tasting on the finish.",2007
US,Merlot,86,18,Comtesse Thérèse 2005 First Harvest Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"After the scent of char blows off a bit, this first harvest Merlot opens sweetly to aromas of vanilla, cinnamon spice and plush, red plums. There's a hint of green stalks and leaves detectable on the palate amidst underripe black cherry and plum flavors, but bright acidity gives this wine a fresh character and the spiced plum finish is pleasant.",2005
New Zealand,Chardonnay,84,17,Chancellor Estates 2000 Mt. Cass Road Chardonnay (Waipara),Joe Czerwinski,"A heavier style, seeming almost slightly oxidized in its ripe apple and honey flavors. Picks up some interesting mineral and sage notes along the way to a long, spicy finish.",2000
US,Chardonnay,86,60,Patland 2011 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),NA,"Dry and oaky, this Chardonnay offers herb-inflected pineapple and pear flavors.",2011
Italy,Arneis,84,27,Cornarea 2007  Roero Arneis,NA,"Bracing notes of quince are the opening act for this fragrant, light-bodied quaffer. There's well-defined acidity in the mouth and zesty flavors of lime and grapefruit on the finish. A good choice for salty hors d'oeuvres.",2007
France,Red Blend,87,NA,Château d'Estoublon 2009 Red (Les Baux de Provence),Roger Voss,"This is a juicy, fruity wine that balances concentrated red-fruit flavors with elegant herbal notes and a delicately acidic structure. The finish is fresh and crisp. Drink from 2014.",2009
US,Rhône-style Red Blend,88,34,Bunnell 2008 Lia Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"Mourvèdre dominates the 2008 Lia, with Grenache, Counoise and Syrah filling in the rest. Fragrant and plummy, it's a mouth-filling Rhône-style blend, with smooth, lightly chocolaty tannins.",2008
US,Zinfandel,84,28,Columbia Winery 2005 Zinfandel (Horse Heaven Hills),Paul Gregutt,"This hits 15.5% alcohol—amazingly high for a Columbia wine. The tart red fruit is offset with sweet grain and dried herbs, almost like an old vine Zin from northern California. Somehow the herbs overmatch the berry flavors, which seem a bit on the light side, despite the high alcohol. Young vines?",2005
US,Zinfandel,85,18,Sierra Starr 2009 Old Clone Zinfandel (Nevada County),Virginie Boone,"Tight, savory and austere, this mountain-grown Zin needs time to show its very peppery nature and sly red fruit, but will pair expertly with pizza or other pasta.",2009
Italy,Nascetta,87,NA,Serra dei Fiori 2015 La Regina Nascetta (Langhe),Kerin O’Keefe,"Made entirely with native grape Nascetta, this opens with aromas of white spring flower and a whiff of hay. The straightforward, rather lean palate offers tropical fruit, lemon zest and a hint of toasted hazelnut alongside refreshing acidity.",2015
US,White Blend,85,13,Waterbrook 2015 Melange Founder's White Blend White (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sean P. Sullivan,"Vibrant aromas of pineapple, flowers, peach and lychee lead to an palate that leans sweeter than off dry. Stone-fruit flavors linger on the finish.",2015
US,Zinfandel,90,25,Peterson 2012 Dry Creek Blend Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),Virginie Boone,"A tang of black cherry and citrus elevates the palate of this light-bodied wine, which is soft and well integrated in terms of oak and tannin. With 10% Petite Sirah and 8% Carignane, it's strong in leather and black pepper, with a lean, juicy finish.",2012
Portugal,Portuguese Red,87,15,J. Portugal Ramos 2012 Marquês de Borba Red (Alentejo),Roger Voss,"One of Portugal's most popular brands, this is rich, soft, solidly textured. It's a fine blend of five grapes including Syrah and Cabernet, giving a warm, enveloping feel. Acidity offers a balance, leaving a ripe, full flavored wine that needs a few months but is ready now.",2012
US,Cabernet Franc,88,25,Heron Hill 2012 Ingle Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While round and supple in style, this has a puckering note of sour plums that mingle amid ripe blackberry and cherry flavors. It's uniquely tart and rich, but nuanced with fine, layered tannins and just a touch of brine that lingers on the finish.",2012
Chile,Chardonnay-Viognier,84,10,Viñedos Marchigüe 2015 City Wine Reserva Chardonnay-Viognier (Colchagua Valley),Michael Schachner,"The mild but slightly tired aromas of apple, honey and haystack announce a soft palate with apple, nectarine and tropical flavors. A yeasty, somewhat hollow finish indicates this is starting to break down. Drink this 80% Chardonnay and 20% Viognier blend immediately.",2015
US,Chardonnay,92,27,Y Rousseau 2015 Constance Haynes Vineyard Chardonnay (Coombsville),Virginie Boone,"Intensely perfumed this dark golden vineyard-designate is young and still resolving, youthfully fresh and alive. Coconut, Brazil nut and Asian pear give it context and texture, with a background invitation of homemade biscuit.",2015
France,Chardonnay,89,NA,Olivier Leflaive 2010 Vauvry Premier Cru  (Rully),Roger Voss,"Made from fruit that's sourced from the northern Côte Chalonnaise, this structured wine shows crisp acids and bright yellow fruits, with a sense of richness that comes from the vanilla and apricot flavors. The finish is laced with refreshing acidity.",2010
Portugal,Port,89,40,Ramos-Pinto NV RP10 Quinta da Ervamoira Tawny 10 Years  (Port),Roger Voss,"Ervamoira, one of the most remote of the Douro estates, produces this full, fruity 10-year-old tawny. It's already drinkable, and it offers almond, raisin and treacle flavors that are lifted by the acids. Drink now.",NA
Australia,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,92,40,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2006 Parson's Flat Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Padthaway),Joe Czerwinski,"The blend is roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Cabernet, and the result combines berries with cassis and generosity with structure, all framed by toasty oak. Savory in character, long and dusty on the finish. Drink now-2018.",2006
France,Pinot Noir,93,46,Domaine de Suremain 2015 En Sazenay Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Roger Voss,"This is a perfumed wine, opulent and with a fine smoky structure. With great ripe berry and red-currant fruit, the wine has a juicy character, bright and crisp with acidity while also solidly textured. Drink this wine from 2023.",2015
US,Sauvignon Blanc,87,24,Steven Kent 2013 Lola Sauvignon Blanc (Livermore Valley),Jim Gordon,"A bold white wine, it smells and tastes like grapefruit, canteloupe and very crisp apples. It has a fresh, acidic texture that cleans the palate and makes the mouth water, but wraps in enough richness for good balance.",2013
Germany,Riesling,90,23,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier 2011 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Smoke and crushed stone notes add a savory, earthy element to sweet, honeyed tangerine and apricot flavors on this bright, brisk, remarkably complex Riesling. It's delicately structured but penetrating in style with a long, focused finish.",2011
US,Cabernet Sauvignon-Barbera,84,45,Icaria Creek 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon-Barbera (Alexander Valley),NA,"One of the last ‘98s to be released, and still dark in color. The tannins are hefty, although they're of the soft, pliant kind, and acidity is low. Oak overshadows the fruit. Not offering much now, and doesn't seem to be an ager.",1998
Spain,Red Blend,89,25,Celler Bàrbara Forés 2008 El Templari Red (Terra Alta),Michael Schachner,"This almost see-through blend of Grenache and the native Morenillo grape is a throwback wine with dry cherry and plum aromas, a fresh and racy palate, and mild but attractive raspberry, plum and vanilla flavors. It's all about freshness and elegance, with a lightness of being. Drink now.",2008
Austria,Weissburgunder,87,19,Josef Ehmoser 2006 Weissburgunder (Wagram-Donauland),Roger Voss,"Ehmoser is a young grower going places. This Weissburgunder (aka Pinot Blanc) is full-bodied, but with an emphasis of green, fresh fruits. There is acidity in spadesful, giving a crisp aftertaste. Screwcap.",2006
Italy,Müller-Thurgau,87,20,Abbazia di Novacella 2010 Müller-Thurgau (Alto Adige),NA,"Aromatic, rich, creamy and intense, this beautiful Italian cool-climate Müller-Thurgau would pair with spicy Thai or Vietnamese dishes. The wine is beautifully linear and clean overall.",2010
US,Merlot-Cabernet Franc,90,48,Terlato 2009 Angels' Peak Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),NA,"For maximum enjoyment, drink this almost all-Merlot blend now. It shows ripe, lush black-cherry, red currant, plum and bacon flavors that finish spicy and sweet tasting. The tannins are thick but smooth.",2009
Portugal,Port,89,29,Quinta de la Rosa 2010 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),Roger Voss,"Bottled at four years old, this wine has retained all its fruitiness. Bright plum flavors go with the dusty tannins and sweetness to create a generous wine with plenty of room for fruit acidity. Drink now, but the wine could age a couple of years.",2010
Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,84,10,Carmen 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),Michael Schachner,"Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy. Finishes with heft, length and weight, which all seems a little overbearing given the wine's simplicity. Just good enough but doesn't fully click.",2009
France,Cabernet Franc,87,15,Château du Coudray Montpensier 2016 Le Grand Bouqueteau  (Chinon),Roger Voss,"While this is certainly a young fruity wine, it also has a soft texture to go with the juicy black fruits to make it ready to drink now. It is smoky, lightly tannic and packed full of ripe fruits.",2016
Portugal,Portuguese White,84,10,Valle da Fonte 2015 White (Douro),Roger Voss,"This is an attractive, warm, rounded wine. Yellow fruit flavors are cut with white fruit and acidity. It has a smooth, creamy texture that gives it extra richness. Drink now.",2015

Australia,Malbec,84,8,Yellow Tail 2010 Malbec (Australia),Joe Czerwinski,"Possibly understating it, this Australian Malbec is boldly colored, with intensely fresh and grapy aromas and robust blueberry flavors. It's a bit simple and possibly a little on the sweet side, but fills the mouth with plenty of flavor.",2010
US,Pinot Gris,92,25,Les Belles Collines 2015 Pinot Gris (California),Virginie Boone,"Crisp, clean flavors of apple and apricot shine in this medium-bodied, lively and dry white, an ideal companion at the table. A sly finish of lemon peel adds to its refreshment, and it's best enjoyed now.",2015
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86,12,Château Jarr 2015  Bordeaux,Roger Voss,The wine is firm with tannins as well as black-currant fruit. It does have a juicy edge that will develop well as it matures. Drink this potentially attractive wine from 2018.,2015
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90,22,Château La Clarière Laithwaite 2011  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,Roger Voss,"While structured and firm, this is a ripe and juicy wine. Its texture has some minerality, lending an edge to intensely youthful acidity. As the wine ages, all these elements will integrate well, so drink from 2016.",2011
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,84,17,Château Cadillac 2009 Cuvée J.J. Lesgourges  (Bordeaux Supérieur),Roger Voss,"As its 14.5% indicates, this is a particularly rich wine. Maybe too rich, because it is all superripe black fruit without the balance of structure or acidity. Enjoy it as a blockbuster, probably not with food.",2009
France,Rhône-style White Blend,94,75,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 1999 Chevalier de Sterimberg White (Hermitage),Roger Voss,"Jaboulet's white Hermitage is named after the crusading knight who built and settled in the small chapel on the Hermitage hill. The wine itself is powerful, rich and concentrated, with heady perfumes of wild flowers and nuts. The palate combines a hint of wood, a full-bodied, oily texture and a stunning burst of acidity that leaves a crisp aftertaste.",1999
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,28,Obsidian Ridge 2009 Obsidian Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),NA,"If you're used to soft, ripe Napa Valley Cabernet, this one, grown just over the Lake County border, will strike you as dry and unyielding. The tannins are pronounced, giving it a hard bite. But it's rich and deep in crème de cassis, the sort of wine that seems ageworthy. Take a gamble and put it in your cellar for 6–8 years.",2009
US,Rosé,84,12,Underwood 2014 Rosé (Oregon),Paul Gregutt,"Minty and light, the fruit here does not seem to have obtained optimal ripeness, even for rosé. Scents and flavors suggest pine needle and wintergreen rather than any hint of berry or melon.",2014
Australia,Chardonnay,87,13,Heritage Road 1998 Chardonnay (Hunter Valley),NA,"Round and ripe tropical fruit mark this solid and affordable Chardonnay. Interesting shadings of lime, clove and other spices keep it engaging on the palate. Ends with a medium- length finish of sweet-tart pineapple fruit.",1998
US,Riesling,89,30,Fox Run 2010 Riesling 12 Lake Dana Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),Anna Lee C.

US,Cabernet Sauvignon,93,75,Rodney Strong 2007 Brothers Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),NA,"This nearly 100% Cabernet is strongly flavored, bone dry, very tannic and nowhere near ready. It has a tough, astringent mouthfeel, and the concentrated richness of grapes grown on low-yielding hillsides. Intense flavors of blackberries, black cherries, cassis, cola and herbs mark this fine, ageable wine. Don't touch it before 2013, and it should ride out many years beyond that.",2007
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88,22,Château Peyredon Lagravette 2013  Haut-Médoc,Roger Voss,"This small 10-acre property has produced an attractively fruity wine with soft tannins and juicy black-fruit flavors. It is lightly structured—displaying more fruit than tannin—and has a fresh, bright aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",2013
US,Red Blend,89,20,Thurston Wolfe 2010 The Spaniard Red (Horse Heaven Hills),Paul Gregutt,"A blend of mostly Grenache, with smaller amounts of Tempranillo and Syrah, this is smooth and polished, with dried fruit flavors.

Italy,Sauvignon,85,12,Torre di Luna 2011 Sauvignon (Delle Venezie),NA,"Torre di Luna is an Italian brand you can count on for value and good cheer. This offers crisp aromas of citrus and tomato leaf, followed by a fresh mouthfeel.",2011
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92,NA,Château Rouget 2009  Pomerol,Roger Voss,"This rounded wine is dense, with firm tannins that are well molded into its sweet-tasting structure. Packed with ripe fruit, this will age relatively quickly, giving pleasure in 5–6 years.",2009
US,Rhône-style Red Blend,91,38,The Withers Winery 2013 Ruben Red (El Dorado),Jim Gordon,"This is a well-balanced, handsomely composed wine that is big in flavor and full in body. The aromas are spicy like black pepper and cardamom, the flavors are meaty, peppery, smoky and berry-like, for a great taste experience that goes way beyond the usual. It's made mostly from Mourvèdre grapes, with Syrah and Grenache in supporting roles.",2013
Portugal,Portuguese White,85,11,Wines & Winemakers 2014 Companhia das Lezirias Samora Branco White (Tejo),Roger Voss,"The blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto gives a fruity, fresh and fragrant wine, with lively bright acidity. A lemon edge is filled out by ripe apricot flavor, resulting in a rounded finish. Drink from 2016.",2014
US,Pinot Noir,91,37,Timothy Malone 2015 Chehalem Mountains Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),Paul Gregutt,"A cleverly threaded mix of black cherry extract, cola, brown sugar and baking spice notes, with a dash of espresso, this is undeniably flavor-packed. It's big but remains balanced and nuanced, with all components in proportion. It's drinking well now, so don't delay.",2015
US,Albariño,92,32,Marimar Estate 2011 Don Miguel Vineyard Albariño (Russian River Valley),NA,"With this bottling, Marimar Estate confirms itself as one of the two best, most consistent producers of Albariño in California, along with Longoria.

Italy,Dolcetto,85,15,Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista 2012  Dolcetto d'Alba,Kerin O’Keefe,"This straightforward Dolcetto offers varietal aromas of black cherry, licorice and hints of black pepper, all of which carry over to the palate. Simple but well made.",2012
Italy,Sangiovese,87,NA,Castello di Radda 2004 Riserva Selvale  (Chianti Classico),NA,"Here's a sweet-smelling, very vanilla-based Riserva that has evidently benefited from a sophisticated oak aging regimen to shape a round, soft, modern wine. Its ruby color is bright and luminous and those oaky flavors return on the palate, somewhat eclipsing the fresh berry fruit you would otherwise expect to find here.",2004
US,Rhône-style Red Blend,88,45,Star Angel by Montes 2008 Aurelio's Selection Red (Paso Robles),NA,"This GSM blend is soft and fruity, offering chocolate, blueberry and cherry jam, currant, sweet vanilla and smoky oak flavors. It has a nice complexity, but let it breathe for a while to mellow.",2008
France,Gewürztraminer,83,21,Dopff Au Moulin 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),Roger Voss,"This is soft and lightly flavored. Fruit and some fresh acidity are there along with spice, but the wine seems muted.",2013
Italy,White Blend,88,NA,Valle dell'Acate 2010 Bidis White (Sicilia),NA,"Aged in oak, this blend of Chardonnay and Insolia offers bold aromas of white rose, honey and stone fruit, with a soft, round palate. The creamy finish would pair well with a crab cake or a spicy Thai mango salad.",2010
US,Pinot Noir,92,42,WesMar 2012 Oehlman Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Virginie Boone,"A taste of sarsaparilla and fresh strawberry hulls combine in this soft, velvety and well-structured wine, the bouquet floral in rose petals and earthy dew. Medium to light bodied, it's a lovely sipping wine that will also pair well with food.",2012

Italy,Red Blend,88,16,Sella & Mosca 1995 Tanca Farra Red (Sardinia),NA,"Tanca Farra is the name of the soil; the grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon (50%) and the Sardinian workhorse, Cannonau (50%). They work well together in this wine, which opens nicely to reveal black-fruit notes. The palate experience is ripe tannins, adequate acidity and a good mouthfeel. The finish is long, with cherry and plum notes.",1995
New Zealand,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92,35,Trinity Hill 2014 The Gimblett Gimblett Gravels Red (Hawke's Bay),Joe Czerwinski,"At almost half Cabernet Franc (49%), this is slightly leafier than what most producers are pulling out of the Gimblett Gravels. The balance is Cabernet Sauvignon (39%), with small amounts of Merlot (9%) and Malbec (3%). The tobacco, chocolate and cassis notes are carried by medium body and a firm, dry texture. Drink 2019–2030.",2014
Greece,Assyrtico,89,14,Greek Wine Cellars 2011 Assyrtico (Santorini),Susan Kostrzewa,"Fresh, clean and elegant aromas of citrus and flowers start this classic Assyrtiko.

Spain,Macabeo-Chardonnay,85,12,Las Valles 2009 Macabeo-Chardonnay (Cariñena),Michael Schachner,"Tropical on the nose, with lychee fruit and tangerine aromas. The palate is easygoing and fairly thorough, while the flavor profile suggest Argentine Torrontés as it deals lychee, powdered sugar and papaya. Clean, light, quaffable and that's about it.",2009
Argentina,Torrontés,83,14,Tercos 2016 Torrontés (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"Oily, floral aromas are typical of this variety. A round but flat palate shows modest acidity, while this tastes lightly oxidized and of lychee and nectarine. The finish is flat.",2016
Italy,Sangiovese,86,17,Podere dal Nespoli 2015 Prugneto Sangiovese (Romagna),Kerin O’Keefe,This densely hued wine has aromas of black plum and vanilla that carry over to the simple palate along with a touch of cedar. Pliant tannins give it an easygoing nature. Drink soon.,2015
US,Pinot Noir,91,65,Penner-Ash 2014 Aegrina Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),Paul Gregutt,"From grapes grown at some of the Willamette Valley's highest elevations, this is a pungent mix of citrus oil, grapefruit, metal shavings and stone. The flavors persist along that path, crafting a sleek and distinctive wine that in many ways is the antithesis of the fleshy, jammy, fruit-forward style of many domestic Pinots.",2014
Italy,Merlot,86,13,Vecchia Cantina di Montepulciano 2008 Poggio Stella Merlot (Cortona),NA,"This easy Poggio Stella Merlot is redolent of black cherry, mature raspberry and currants.

US,Chardonnay,92,26,La Honda Winery 2015 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),Matt Kettmann,"Key-lime rinds, pink grapefruit, crisp pluot, just-ripe pineapple, nectarine and a steely gunmetal aroma show on the nose of this bottling. There's an intriguing touch of sweet onion to the sip. The laser-sharp precision would pair well with shellfish, but a slightly buttered warmth makes the bottling quite versatile.",2015
France,Chardonnay,93,64,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils 2002 Fleuron Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),Roger Voss,"This recently released 2002 is still showing its youth, with a firm, mineral edge to it. But it does have the right refreshingly crisp character, along with intense fruits, and acidity that just powers right through. Wait 3–4 years.",2002
Australia,Chardonnay,87,12,Jacob's Creek 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (South Australia),Joe Czerwinski,"JC is making an effort to upgrade its Reserve range, and this is a good example, offering peach and pineapple flavors framed by vanilla, butter and toast. It's all barrel-fermented, impressive at this production level (25,000 cases) and price point.",2006
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85,7,Château Taussin 2014 Premium  (Bordeaux),Roger Voss,"Although obviously still young, this fruity wine will develop fast. It benefits from the ripe fruit of the vintage, sweet black currants and berries that are given a crisp edge by the acidity. Already balanced, it will be drinkable from 2016.",2014
US,Sauvignon Blanc,88,21,Carica 2010 Kick Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),NA,"A very nice Sauvignon, easy to drink, and showing lots of style and elegance. Bone dry and zesty in acidity, it has citrus, tropical fruit and white pepper flavors, with a stimulating touch of tart gooseberry.",2010
Italy,Sparkling Blend,91,NA,Contadi Castaldi 2008 Zero Sparkling (Franciacorta),NA,"This edition of Dosaggio Zero shows delicate harmony and complexity with layers of stone fruit, citrus, almond and white flower. Zesty perlage is enhanced by more stone fruit flavors on the silky finish.",2008
South Africa,Shiraz,89,30,Robertson Winery 2009 Number One Constitution Road Shiraz (Robertson),Lauren Buzzeo,"This is a decadent and plush wine, with ripe-fruit notes of brambly raspberry and blueberry accented by hints of pepper, vanilla and sweet spice.

Australia,Cabernet Sauvignon,95,500,Penfolds 2014 Bin 707 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),Joe Czerwinski,"This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones. Drink 2020–2030, and probably well beyond.",2014
Italy,Sangiovese,92,70,Le Macioche 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,Kerin O’Keefe,"Rose, iris, dark-skinned berry, forest floor and a whiff of cake spice lead the way on this full-bodied red. The firmly structured palate shows crushed raspberry, juicy Marasca cherry, star anise and a hint of clove while fresh acidity and big chewy tannins provide support. Drink 2019–2027.",2012
US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91,43,Baer 2014 Ursa Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is equally split between Merlot and Cabernet Franc (38% each), with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (22%) and Malbec. The aromas are brooding, with notes of barrel spice, coffee, blackberry, green pepper and dried herb. The flavors are bright and fresh, light on their feet, showing a fine sense of elegance and detail.",2014
Italy,Red Blend,97,325,Marchesi Antinori 2010 Solaia Red (Toscana),Kerin O’Keefe,"Already one of Italy's most iconic bottlings, this gorgeous 2010 is already a classic. Its complex and intense bouquet unfolds with ripe blackberries, violets, leather, thyme and balsamic herbs. The palate shows structure, poise and complexity, delivering rich black currants, black cherry, licorice, mint and menthol notes alongside assertive but polished tannins and vibrant energy. This wine will age and develop for decades. Drink 2018–2040.",2010
US,Pinot Noir,91,52,Williams Selyem 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),NA,"This shows the lovely balance of both the winery and the appellation, with a silky, lightly tannic mouthfeel brightened by plenty of acidity.

US,Petite Sirah,87,32,Nottingham Cellars 2009 Black Label Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley),Virginie Boone,"Collin Cranor is a young, eager winemaker looking to make his mark in the Livermore Valley and this wine shows off his skill and ability to work with great fruit to make an interesting wine. Savory, this Petite Sirah has classic notes of chocolate, cherry and berry, though it benefits from a bit of air and time to open. Try it with meaty dishes; if they include bacon, all the better.",2009
US,Chardonnay,90,28,Lundeen 2012 Dennison Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"Barrel-fermented in neutral oak, this is a ripe, creamy wine with mix of pineapple and buttered nuts. The secondary fermentation was stopped at 50%, leaving generous acidity and balancing out the intensity of the fruit. This wine punches above its price weight, and will drink well now through 2020.",2012
US,Cabernet Franc,91,28,Tamarack Cellars 2007 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),Paul Gregutt,"This is 100% varietal, this winery's most popular varietal offering, and nicely distinguished from its other reds. Recently bottled, it was still slightly shocked when tasted. Dark fruits, most especially cassis, are woven together with smoke (no mirrors!) and bitter chocolate. Chewy, earthy tannins hold the finish and complement the wine's natural peppery spice.",2007
US,Pinot Noir,96,30,Sineann 2015 TFL Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"This ultra reserve, made in half bottles only, is labeled the winery's best offering. It lives up to the claim, with stunningly rich and broad flavors of black fruits, dusty cedar, tobacco, tea and coffee. The rich and complex barrel flavors are beautifully integrated, seamless and proportioned, and power through a breathtaking finish that lasts for minutes. Drink now and over the next five years.",2015
France,Gros and Petit Manseng,92,18,Domaine Cauhapé 2010 Sève d'Automne  (Jurançon Sec),Roger Voss,"A blend of 70% Gros Manseng and 30% Petit Manseng, this is a serious, full-bodied wine that's rich and concentrated. It has weight, ripe quince and green plum flavors, and strong herb and honey elements. It is ready to drink, although it should last up to a year.",2010
US,Pinot Noir,90,48,Sojourn 2010 Wohler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),NA,"This is Sojourn's most successful 2010 Pinot Noir, because it's the ripest and most satisfying. It shows rich, tantalizing raspberry, cherry and cola flavors that are brightened by brisk acidity. It earns extra points for its complexity.",2010
Italy,Aglianico,83,NA,Perillo 2004  Taurasi,NA,"Earthy tones of farmyard, wet wool and dewy hay probably weren't by design. It's hard to get at the real fruit although glimmers of blueberry and black cherry do break through. The wine has tight, thick extraction.",2004
Spain,Red Blend,86,49,Cesca Vicent 2008 Abat Domènech Red (Priorat),Michael Schachner,"With seven years in bottle, this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is what it is. The nose is stewy and raisiny, with baked berry notes. Like the nose, it feels raisiny and heavy. Flavors of raisin, fig and chocolate keep the theme going, while the finish is herbal and earthy in flavor, with heat.",2008
US,Syrah,92,75,Sanguis 2011 Bossman Syrah (Central Coast),Matt Kettmann,"Quirky, art-minded winemaker Matthias Sanguis crafts a stellar Syrah, with a lush bouquets of violets, blue raspberry, black peppercorns and vanilla.

Italy,Sangiovese Grosso,92,43,Bonacchi 2006 Casalino  (Brunello di Montalcino),NA,"Casalino's Brunello is a dark, pleasurable wine enhanced by warm richness, mineral notes, toasted almond and sweet black cherry. The general smoothness and fullness of the texture is what sets this wine apart.",2006
France,Red Blend,85,11,Château Lecusse 2009 Grappes d'Or Red (Gaillac),Roger Voss,"A classic Gaillac blend of Duras, Gamay, Merlot and Syrah, this is a bright, fruity wine, the lighter of the two wines produced at Château Lecusse. Red berries dominate, allied to crisp acidity.",2009
US,Gewürztraminer,85,15,Bargetto 2010 Viento Vineyard Gewurztraminer (Monterey County),NA,"This seems like one of the sweeter Gewürztraminers out there, with flavors of white sugar, Asian pear, lychee and spice. The sweetness is balanced with crisp acidity.",2010
Portugal,Portuguese White,86,13,Real Companhia Velha 2015 Evel Branco White (Douro),Roger Voss,"Grown on the plateau above the Douro valley, this wine is rich, generous and finely balanced. Green plum and citrus acidity are dominant, while ripe melon and spice grace the finish. Drink now.",2015
Austria,Grüner Veltliner,91,16,Hermann Moser 2015 Karmeliterberg Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Lifted pear-drop aromas are accompanied by the peppery green of watercress and arugula. The concentrated palate is grounded by earthy, savory yeast notes and framed by fresh lime peel. There is a dollop of riper pear fruit at the core, shining and shimmering with added charm.",2015
Italy,Nero d'Avola,87,46,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello 2012 Lu Patri Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of toasted oak, espresso, vanilla and ripe berry lead the nose. The palate offers oak extract, roasted coffee bean, mocha and dark cherry. It's full-bodied, with drying and rather fleeting tannins.",2012
US,Chardonnay,87,10,Fox Run 2012 Doyle Family Vineyard Unoaked Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Dusty mineral and saline notes lend interest to aromatic peach and apricot on this pretty, perfumed Chardonnay. The palate is refreshingly mineral, while the finish is brisk and nervy.",2012
US,Rosé,90,30,Wölffer 2016 Grandioso Rosé (Long Island),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This unusual rosé is a blend of both white and red grapes fermented together in oak barrels, but there's a nary a hint of toast or vanilla to suggest time in oak. It's an exceptionally well-integrated wine with fine finessed berry and watermelon flavors along with delicate hints of spice and cherry blossom. Zesty acidity and a fresh saline finish lend to its refreshing appeal.",2016
US,Pinot Noir,89,38,David Hill 2008 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"This is the most intractable of the winery's 2008 Pinot Noirs, holding back in the glass and showing plenty of grip and tannin. Tight and compact, with a distinctive black pepper scent, this wine needs more bottle age. With time, the score could certainly improve.",2008
US,Merlot,91,22,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2005 Canoe Ridge Estate Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),Paul Gregutt,"A strong contender for the best $22 Merlot in the country. Sculpted, dense and deeply layered, it's loaded with mixed blue and black fruits, fresh herb and sweet toast. The use of new oak is restrained and appropriate, extending the finish with nicely applied streaks of coffee around ripe, tight, dry tannins.",2005
US,Pinot Noir,84,11,Cycles Gladiator 2013 Pinot Noir (California),Jim Gordon,"This has a traditional garnet color with a light rim. It smells a bit earthy and herbal and tastes rather lean, like rhubarb and sour-cherry candy. It's light to medium bodied, a bit quirky but enjoyable.",2013
Austria,Red Blend,88,19,Hannes Reeh 2014 Heideboden Red (Burgenland),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Bold blueberry notes are bolstered by aromatic hints of cinnamon and make for a juicy, fleshy nose and palate. It seems like this wine has juicy, berry-ish fun written all over its smooth, easy body. Drink now.",2014
Argentina,Malbec,84,16,Michel Torino 2009 Don David Reserve Malbec (Calchaquí Valley),Michael Schachner,"A disjointed, out-of-the-box Malbec that starts out peanutty and earthy on the nose. Things round out aromatically, but in the mouth it's angular and edgy, with stunted blackberry flavors offset by tartness. Has its positives but overall it doesn't fully click.",2009
Spain,Tempranillo,92,40,Torrederos 2009 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),Michael Schachner,"Aromas of crushed minerals, blackened spices, blackberry and dark cherry are integrated and whole. The palate is ripe and tannic but not fierce, with blackberry, black cherry, toast and spice flavors that finish chocolaty and rich, with nutmeg-like notes and length. Best from 2015 through 2022.",2009
Italy,Grillo,86,11,Stemmari NV Baci Vivaci Grillo (Vino Spumante),Kerin O’Keefe,"A fun and informal sparkler, made from the native Sicilian grape Grillo, this opens with aromas of white flowers and acacia. The lively palate offers white peach, green apple and pineapple alongside bright acidity and persistent bubbles.",NA
Germany,Riesling,93,365,Robert Weil 2013 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Initial whiffs of nuts and bruised apple blow away, revealing radiant aromas of marmalade and honey on this unctuous yet delicate wine. A shock of lemony acidity jolts the palate, but recovery comes quickly with plush peach and tangerine sweetness. The finish is silky smooth and endless.",2013
Spain,Verdejo,86,12,Cantarranas 2014 Verdejo (Rueda),Michael Schachner,"Gritty aromas of match stick and nut skins blend with light citrus aromas. This feels plump but also vaguely citric, with lime and grapefruit flavors that finish well.",2014
Austria,Grüner Veltliner,91,27,Ingrid Groiss 2015 Braitenpuechtorff Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Very fresh, fruity and appetizing notes of juicy pear make this very easy to like and sip. The palate is fresh and made light and zingy by lovely zesty lime and lemon notes. A vein of white pepper is fizzing away at the core. It's a perfect summer wine with the slightest spritz.",2015
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92,NA,Château Providence 2011 Barrel Sample  (Pomerol),Roger Voss,"91-93. Barrel sample. This has an herbal character along with spice. It's juicy, with intense acidity.",2011
US,Chardonnay,91,24,Fleuron 2011 Chardonnay (Sonoma County-Lake County),NA,"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay seemingly tastes as sweet as a dessert, although it's technically dry. With its pineapple and tangerine tart, crême brulée and Key lime pie flavors, Chardonnay doesn't get richer than this. Brisk, citrusy acidity gives much needed balance.",2011
France,Riesling,83,15,Pierre Deschamps 2012 Riesling (Alsace),Roger Voss,"Soft and aromatic, this is a crisp, clean and fruity wine. It has some sweetness (not indicated on the label) with lime and tangy citrus flavors. It's ready to drink.",2012
France,Sauvignon Blanc,90,30,Domaine Girard 2016 Philippe Girard Cuvée Silex  (Sancerre),Roger Voss,"The flinty silex soil is reflected in the steely flinty texture of this wine. It lies under the crisp and nervy white and citrus fruits. The result is a wine that is under tension, still young and needing time to open up with its full potential. Drink from late 2018.",2016
Italy,Nebbiolo,90,NA,Brandini 2011 Brandini  (Barolo),Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of perfumed berry, mint baking spice, toast and espresso waft out of the glass. The palate is tight and rather primary at the moment, showing raw black cherry, raspberry, clove and toasted notes. It's still young but balanced, with fresh acidity and firm, fine–grained tannins. Drink 2016–2022.",2011
US,Albariño,91,NA,Tangent 2012 Paragon Vineyard Sparkling Albariño (Edna Valley),Matt Kettmann,"Fresh and light on the nose, this rare bottling of a sparkling Albariño shows crème fraiche, wet stone and the slight tang of green-apple skin on the nose. The bubbles are moderate on the sip, where green tomato, lime rinds and Granny Smith apple combine to make a fascinating and rather pleasing sip.",2012
US,Grenache,88,27,Ott & Murphy 2012 Grenache (Rattlesnake Hills),Sean P. Sullivan,This wine shows a lot of reduction that provides off-putting aromas. The strawberry and cranberry flavors are full and show pleasing purity and length. The disconnect between the aromas and flavors is substantial but some time in a decanter might sync them up.,2012
Italy,Sangiovese,86,20,Castello di Bossi 2013  Chianti Classico,Kerin O’Keefe,"Forest floor, porcini mushroom, violet and a whiff of chopped herbs lead the nose on this simple red.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,93,30,Global Wines NV Cabriz Impar Red (Vinho Licoroso),Roger Voss,"This fortified red blend was aged in wood for 20 years. That has taken away fruitiness and, as with an aged Tawny Port, has given the wine flavors of dried prune, spice and old wood aromas. The wine is for sipping and savoring, ready to drink now.",NA
US,Sauvignon Blanc,88,22,Ousterhout 2013 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),Virginie Boone,"Bristling in acidity and steely in wet stone, this SB is crisp and layered in lemon, with more lemon on the finish. It yearns for shellfish.",2013
South Africa,Chardonnay,88,25,Muratie 2009 Isabella Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),Lauren Buzzeo,"So fresh and balanced, there's structured mineral-driven support to the red apple, juicy lemon and sweet spice flavors.

France,Red Blend,90,NA,Jean-Luc Baldès 2008 Clos Triguedina Red (Cahors),Roger Voss,"As pure an expression of a Malbec dominated blend as possible, this is ripe, juicy, packed with fine acidity and underpinned by solid, dry tannins. It balances the firm, dry character with delicious, forward, juicy fruit.",2008
US,Sauvignon Blanc,87,18,Di Arie 2014 Estate Grown & Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (El Dorado),Jim Gordon,"An overtly fruity aroma and lightly sweet citrus flavors make this medium-bodied wine easy to enjoy.

Spain,Sparkling Blend,88,14,Biutiful NV Brut Sparkling (Cava),Michael Schachner,"Green apple, citrus and distant celery aromas feed into a fresh, peppy, citrusy palate with tangerine, lime and pink grapefruit flavors. The finish is citrusy like the palate, meaning it's bright, juicy and dry.",NA

US,Pinot Noir,85,75,Archery Summit 2004 Renegade Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Paul Gregutt,"A light entry holds flavors of strawberry and tomato leaf, then turns tannic. Chewy and earthy, with more than a hint of seed and stem, this wine comes from biodynamically farmed grapes that add some earthy nuances, but put too much emphasis on green tea, stemmy flavors.",2004
US,Sauvignon Blanc,86,14,Murphy-Goode 2011 The Fumé Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast),Virginie Boone,"An easy-drinking Sauvignon Blanc thats fermented in barrel and stainless steel, this has a depth of pear, tangerine and lime flavors.

US,Pinot Noir,93,70,Tantara 2012 Zotovich Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Matt Kettmann,"Light and a bit cloudy in appearance, this wine begins with a nose of wet slate and raspberry.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,85,8,Casa Agricola Santos Jorge 2014 Toutalga Red (Alentejano),Roger Voss,"This is a young, fruity wine with fine acidity and plenty of red-fruit flavors. Light spice, generous tannins and a hint of wood all contribute to a balanced wine that is ready to drink.",2014
Portugal,Portuguese Red,91,26,Casa da Passarella 2008 Vinhas Velhas Red (Dão),Roger Voss,"The extra concentration of low-yielding old vines is apparent in this dark, brooding wine.

Made from fruit that's sourced from the foothills of Portugal's highest mountains, this has a distinctly structured and dense finish.",2008
Italy,White Blend,85,12,Miali 2011 Dolcimèlo White (Martina),NA,"This blend of Verdesca, Bianco d'Alessano and Fiano Minutolo (three white grapes indigenous to southern Italy) shows a slightly oxidized style, with aromas of caramel, peach and exotic fruit.

France,Pinot Noir,93,463,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2013  Bonnes-Mares,Roger Voss,"Still way too young, this is developing into a substantial and structured wine. Full of both fruit and tannins, it is dark and dense, very dry at this stage but with the most enticing perfumes. The Grand Cru, split between Chambolle-Musigny and Morey Saint-Denis, is known for its structure and this wine is a great example. Drink from 2020.",2013
Australia,Chardonnay,91,25,Sidewood 2015 Mappinga Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills),Joe Czerwinski,"This silky-textured, medium-bodied wine starts off with aromas of toasted marshmallow and ripe citrus.

Italy,Friulano,88,26,Plozner 2006 Moscabianca Friulano (Venezia Giulia),NA,"Here is a pretty, luminous wine from old vines with ripe tones of stone fruit, apricot and honey that would pair very well with seafood or white meat. It has a thick, chewy texture and refreshing acidity on the finish.",2006
US,Syrah,91,32,Melville 2014 Estate Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),Matt Kettmann,"There's intriguing precision to the nose of this bottling from Chad Melville and family. A laser-sharp line of tart elderberry, black-plum skins and black-cherry skins cut through the dark earth, tar and purple-flower elements. The palate blends approachable black raspberry, dark strawberry and muddled mulberry fruit with touches of coffee and dark cocoa.",2014
Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon,88,23,Viña Cobos 2014 Felino Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"Cedary oak, tobacco, wood spice and black-fruit aromas are on the heavy side.

Pushy black-fruit flavors come with chocolate and herbal notes, while this tastes of chocolate mint and feels scratchy and tannic on the finish.",2014
France,Sauvignon Blanc,92,46,Domaine Vincent Delaporte 2013 Silex Cuvée Maxime  (Sancerre),Roger Voss,"Very closed and tight, this is still a young wine. Its fruitiness, with citrus and pear flavors, is just beginning to develop into something that's rich and full-bodied.

US,Pinot Noir,90,36,Scott Paul 2010 La Paulée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"Production is lower for this cuvée in 2010, and the sources now incude Nysa and Ribbon Ridge along with Maresh.

Overall this is elegant, balanced and strongest on the midpalate.",2010
US,Pinot Noir,87,22,Amity Vineyards 2008 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"Soft, pretty and pleasant to drink, the widely-available Willamette Valley bottling from Amity might pass for a simple Bourgogne rouge.

US,Chardonnay,92,60,Newton 2007 Unfiltered Chardonnay (Napa County),NA,"Very dry, a lean, austere Chardonnay currently marked by aloof flavors of lemons, limes and oak. Yet there's something going on. As the wine warms in the glass it becomes richer, showing hidden pineapple tart, macadamia and crème brûlée. Firm, minerally acidity is there throughout, making for a mouthwatering cleanliness. Drink this streamlined, Chablis-like wine now–2013.",2007
US,Pinot Noir,86,27,The Forager 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Virginie Boone,"Stemmy and woody, this soft, bright and feral wine is revelatory of its site, where coolness reigns. The taste suggests the hulls of fresh strawberries, while the color, structure and body remain elusively light.",2013
Argentina,Malbec,90,16,Durigutti 2014 Malbec (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"Bold, rubbery aromas of dark-berry fruits and toasty oak precede a hard-driving palate with smoky, peppery black-fruit flavors that pour on the oak and related espresso and toastiness on the finish.

US,Riesling,89,20,Red Newt Cellars 2012 Lahoma Vineyards Riesling (Finger Lakes),Anna Lee C. Iijima,Whiffs of blossoms accent aromas of fresh apples and dusty minerals on this semi-sweet Riesling.

US,Syrah,89,32,Kessler-Haak 2010 Lafond Vineyard Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),NA,"Lots of structure in this Syrah, with brisk acids and firm tannins.

France,Champagne Blend,90,NA,Deutz NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),Roger Voss,"Light and fruity this is a delicate wine that exudes fresh berry fruits and balanced acidity.

US,Cabernet Sauvignon,93,75,Rubicon Estate 2004 Cask Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),NA,"Based on the old 100% Cabs from Inglewood that aged forever, Rubicon's interpretation has the same hard, tough tannins in youth. It's not a wine you want to drink anytime soon. Bursting with cherry, blackberry, plum and vanilla flavors, it has the elegant balance needed for ageability. Best after 2010, and should hold and improve for many years after.",2004
France,Riesling,89,17,Joseph Fritsch 2015 Riesling (Alsace),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Notes of yeast still shimmer on the nose, showing how young this wine is. The palate is fresh and has all the 2015 exuberance of fruit. It offers a zippy, fresh core of citrus and juicy balance, with a dry finish.",2015
Italy,Pinot Grigio,85,NA,Banfi 2010 Le Rime Pinot Grigio (Toscana),NA,"Food friendly, informal and bright, this easy-drinking Pinot Grigio opens with bright citrus, stone fruit and melon. There's a touch of white almond paste on the close that recalls the warm Tuscan sunshine.",2010
US,Chardonnay,88,20,Milbrandt 2006 Legacy Sundance Vineyard Chardonnay (Washington),Paul Gregutt,"This is the oldest of the Milbrandt vineyards, planted in 1997.

Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,83,12,William Cole 2012 Albamar Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),Michael Schachner,"Initially this smells perfumed and powdery, like a grande dame preparing to go out for the night. On deeper inspection, it smells grassy and citrusy, then tastes and feels dilute. At best this is a quaffing wine due to minimal character but good acidity.",2012
US,Pinot Noir,92,40,Alma Fria 2014 Plural Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Virginie Boone,"Blue fruit character comes softly layered with exotic clove and cardamom scents in this elegantly light and vibrant wine.

Spain,Rosado,86,18,Príncipe de Viana 2016 Edición Rosa Rosado (Navarra),Michael Schachner,"This pink Garnacha feels good and plump yet lacks the concentration of a great rosé. It has cherry Lifesaver, vitamin and cheese-like aromas and yeasty citrus flavors that are mild through the finish.",2016

US,Cinsault,90,40,Tercero 2015 Cinsault (Santa Barbara County),Matt Kettmann,"Winemaker Larry Schaffer proudly explores lesser-used varieties such as Cinsault, and makes compelling arguments in their favor.

US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92,55,Pirouette 2012 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is Cabernet Sauvignon (63%) blended with Merlot (19%), Petit Verdot (12%) and Cabernet Franc.

France,Pinot Noir,91,NA,Henri de Villamont 2007 Les Evocelles  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Roger Voss,"A fine combination of tannins and ripe fruit, rich and at the same time solidly structured. The year brings out soft acidity and blackberry juice, and the wine finishes big and bold.",2007
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,88,42,Six Sigma Ranch 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County),NA,"Six Sigma's Cabernet is entirely unproven, but this one shows great promise.

US,Cabernet Sauvignon,84,35,Spann Vineyards 2007 Mayacamas Range Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),NA,"At about six years of age, this Bordeaux blend is soft, fruity and ending its useful lifespan. The cherry and cola flavors are drying out. Drink up.",2007

Italy,Nero d'Avola,85,NA,Tenuta di Serramarrocco 2008 Baglio di Serramarrocco Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),NA,"Baglio di Serramarrocco opens with a slightly browning hue and savory aromas of cured beef and black currant. There's an earthy tone as well, backed by mild grittiness in the mouth.",2008
Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,84,18,Millaman 2014 Limited Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley),Michael Schachner,"Forced, heavy oak aromas lie around as this smells like lacquer, mint and horse hide.

US,Cabernet Sauvignon,85,38,Doukénie 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Virginia),NA,"Like a deconstructed peanut butter and jelly sandwich, this has nutty, toasty aromas that are topped with a generous dollop of strawberry jam. It feels full and slack upon entrance, with slightly pickled acids and firm but integrated tannins that tug on the midpalate. While the flavors overall could use a boost of concentration, a pleasing note of autumn spice lingers on the finish.",2009
France,Sauvignon Blanc,86,9,Paris-Simoneau 2016 Antoine Simoneau Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine),Roger Voss,"This is a stylish attractive wine. It has an herbal touch although it is more about delicious bright fruit. Citrus and crisp apples dominate, laced with acidity. This refreshing wine is ready to drink now.",2016
Portugal,Portuguese Red,82,NA,Herdade do Rocim 2011 Bojador Red (Alentejano),Roger Voss,"An earthy, ripe and fruity wine, it has a solid base of tannins and a rough-edged structure. The black fruits are submerged in the more rustic nature of the wine's aftertaste.",2011
US,Pinot Noir,87,30,Panther Creek 2006 Winemaker's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"This is a supple, forward and pleasantly drinkable wine. If it is to be criticized it's that it lacks precision and focus. The fruit flavors are a diffuse mélange of cherry, berry and plum, leading to a chalky finish that tastes of tartaric acid with a splash of chocolate.",2006
Spain,Tempranillo,92,70,Altos del Terral 2011 T1  (Ribera del Duero),Michael Schachner,"Intense blackberry and black-cherry aromas come with notes of licorice, espresso and barnyard. Huge across the palate, this starts out lush but quickly transitions to hard as rocks and tannic as nails.

Austria,White Blend,90,18,Zahel 2016 White (Wiener Gemischter Satz),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Slight reduction still obstructs this wine's nose. The palate, however, is both zingy and rich—spiked with citrus and rounded with ripe, mellow apple fruit. There is verve and life at its core and tone to its medium body. The dry finish is appetizing.",2016
Italy,Nebbiolo,89,35,Ceste 2014  Barbaresco,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with blue flower, new leather, crushed mint and underbrush aromas. On the taut, racy palate, white pepper and tobacco notes underscore sour cherry and cranberry fruit alongside austere, fine-grained tannins.",2014
Portugal,Portuguese Sparkling,87,19,Caves Transmontanas 2009 Vertice Cuvée Reserva Sparkling (Douro),Roger Voss,"A lively, crisp wine that boasts intense pineapple and citrus fruits. From high-elevation Douro vineyards, it is light and refreshing, with great swathes of acidity.",2009

France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,82,10,Château de Virecourt 2009  Bordeaux,Roger Voss,"Dry, dark-hued tannins cut through the wine, giving it a bitter feel. It is tough, firm, missing the balancing fruit.",2009
US,White Blend,89,38,Round Pond 2014 Proprietary White (Rutherford),Virginie Boone,"This is a hearty, fulsome combo of 70% Sauvignon Blanc and 30% Viognier. It comes off as overtly light at first before gradually revealing full-bodied punches of pear and peach. The Viognier speaks in waves of honey and orange blossom, adding voluptuous texture to the proceedings.",2014
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,91,41,Northstar 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sean P. Sullivan,"The fruit for this 100% varietal wine comes from Cold Creek, Klipsun and Anna Marie vineyards.

Australia,Moscato,85,9,De Bortoli 2011 DB Family Selection Pink Moscato (New South Wales),Joe Czerwinski,"Light and frothy, with perfumed notes of tangerine, spice and a mere hint of strawberry. Falls off a bit on the finish, but still represents a good value in dessert-style bubbles.",2011
US,Riesling,92,32,Pacific Rim 2007 Solstice Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),Paul Gregutt,"The wine is finished at 1.2% residual sugar, but tastes bone dry. It's succulent and juicy, with floral aromas, stone fruits and hints of honeysuckle. Concentrated and dense, it is both bracing and long.

South Africa,Shiraz,94,NA,Saronsberg 2012 Cape Winemakers Guild Sneeusig Shiraz (Tulbagh),Lauren Buzzeo,"Winemaker: Dewaldt Heyns. Big, bold and powerful, this is currently a bruiser, but one that has the components to age well through 2025, at least.

Italy,Nebbiolo,92,NA,Beni di Batasiolo 2006 Vigneto Cerequio  (Barolo),NA,"Beautifully intense and elegant, this opens with fine aromas of spice, dried fruit, cola, tar and ground licorice. It delivers a long, silky sensation in the mouth.",2006

The packed, densely concentrated palate offers raisin, blackberry jam, pipe tobacco, baking spice and dark bitter chocolate framed in bracing, close-grained tannins that still need to unwind.

Austria,Pinot Noir,90,40,Loimer 2012 Langenlois Pinot Noir (Niederösterreich),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Dark smokiness hovers above the fruit, slightly obscuring the view.

Portugal,Rosé,85,9,DFJ Vinhos 2016 Bigode Rosé (Lisboa),Roger Voss,"This is a crisp, clean and refreshing wine. There is just the lightest sense of tannin giving the wine a zingy edge. Other than that, it is red-berry fruits all the way. Drink now.",2016

It's dry and crisp and smooth, and so easy to drink with a fine steak.",2007
US,Chardonnay,93,65,Lange 2014 Freedom Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"This top-tier vineyard delivers gorgeous flavors. Big, juicy, rich and round, it piles on the fruit flavors—apples, pears, white peaches and lemons. All are balanced against each other and the supporting, natural acidity, finished with a frame of new-oak toast. Drink 2016 to 2028.",2014
US,Zinfandel,82,32,Ancient Oak Cellars 2010 Pagnano Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),NA,"A superspicy Zin, marked by a blast of black pepper, clove and anise. The flavors are extracted and sweet to the point of appearing overripe, with blackberries and prunes leading to a tannic, bitter finish. Drink now.",2010
Israel,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85,45,Domaine du Castel 2005 Petit Castel Kosher Red (Haut-Judeé),Lauren Buzzeo,"The 16 months in French oak come through with strong aromas and flavors of coffee, chocolate and roasted coconut accented by black cherry, dark berry and cassis. The body lacks the structure to balance out the sweeter core, but the finish remains delectably loaded with mocha and sweet spice.",2005
Spain,Sparkling Blend,88,20,Segura Viudas NV Reserva Heredad Sparkling (Cava),Michael Schachner,"A dry and austere style is what you're looking at with Heredad. The nose offers simple citrus and soda aromas, while the palate is sheer and defined by apple, light spice and cleansing acidity. Not much depth below the surface but definitely clean and flashy.",NA
Italy,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",85,NA,Villa Canestrari 2006 I Lasi  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso),NA,"I Lasi is a thin and informal Ripasso with easy layers of blueberry and cherry backed by light spice and smoke shadings. There's a slightly sour note in the mouth and the wine ends with a lean, crisp close.",2006
Greece,Red Blend,85,25,Chrisohoou 2008 Red (Rapsani),Susan Kostrzewa,"A rich nose of cloves, exotic spice and tobacco give this red a distinctive edge. The palate offers pronounced allspice and tobacco, touched by sweet oak, tea and red fruit. A good everyday wine with an exotic touch.",2008
Argentina,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,86,39,Bodega Las Cañitas 2009 Familia Navarro Torrre Grand Gold Medal Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Argentina),Michael Schachner,"Gritty aromas of herbal berry fruits and coffee grounds lead to a hard tannic, compact palate with loud acidity. Disparate flavors of burnt coffee, tomato and stewed plum finish with scraping tannins and herbal notes that reflect the nose and palate.",2009
Argentina,Chardonnay,82,10,Trapiche 2011 Oak Cask Chardonnay (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"After light scents of butter and spiced apple surface, the wine turns briny and pickled, both in aromas and flavors. It feels fleshy on the finish, with briny stone-fruit and citrus flavors.",2011
US,Red Blend,88,40,Galante 2014 Bulls Eye Red (Carmel Valley),Matt Kettmann,"Black cherry, crushed concrete and spicy peppercorn show on the nose of this Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah dessert blend.

US,Viognier,86,20,Horton 2013 Viognier (Virginia),Alexander Peartree,"Muddled stone fruit aromas meld with overripe floral tones on the nose. There's a pop of pineapple and mango fruits on the front, with tangerine leading to a short finish. This is a straightforward but enjoyable fruit-bomb.",2013
US,Pinot Noir,92,60,Black Kite 2014 River Turn Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Jim Gordon,"This wine is so ripe, rich and generous in flavor it's almost jammy, but there's no denying the appeal of all that fruitiness. Full body, velvety texture and soft acidity make it plush on the palate, helping the rich finish linger. Although it was aged in French barriques—two-thirds new—it's by no means an overoaked wine.",2014
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,60,Laurel Glen 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),NA,"Hard tannins, dryness and oakiness are the three horsemen that mark this young, vital Cabernet. Is it ageworthy? Absolutely. Once the fruit kicks in, which is pretty much instantly, it's devastatingly rich and spicy in blackberries, blueberries and cassis. Clearly a cellar candidate for at least the next decade.",2006
France,Champagne Blend,87,47,Henri Abele NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),Roger Voss,"A light-colored rosé, this is fresh, soft and fruity. It has attractive raspberry and flaked apple flavors, with well-integrated acidity. It makes a good apéritif style of Champagne with its gentle, warm aftertaste.",NA
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,75,Rodney Strong 2012 Alexander's Crown Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Virginie Boone,"This comes from a vineyard established in 1971—one of the first in the appellation to contribute a single-vineyard bottling of the variety.

There's just not enough there to score higher despite its charms.",1998
US,Sauvignon Blanc,90,24,Rochioli 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),NA,"In this vintage, one of Sonoma's top SBs scores points in all the requisite areas.

A bit of banana sweetens the long, dry finish, leaving you with the right overall impression.",2001
Italy,Glera,87,19,Bortolotti NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),NA,"Bortolotti has a well-earned reputation for steady, classic expressions of Prosecco exemplified by this luminous Extra Dry. Aromas here include spring flower, melon and white peach.",NA
Australia,Shiraz,89,70,Kilikanoon 2008 Oracle Shiraz (Clare Valley),Joe Czerwinski,"This wine starts off with notes of blackberry, mint and asphalt on the nose, unfurling on the tongue to reveal tar, black olive, meat and blackberry flavors.

It has flavors of dried fruits, apricots and pear, and a texture that fills the mouth with a tight, mineral character. Impressive now, it does need to age, or even be decanted before serving.",2002
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,81,16,Castle Rock 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County),NA,"A dreary, simple wine, as thin as water with a few drops of blackberry syrup. It's also soft and bitter on the finish.",2010
US,Sauvignon Blanc,91,14,Husch 2014 La Ribera Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino),Jim Gordon,"A fresh, invigorating citrus and pine flavor energizes this crisp and yet substantive wine in a way that will taste great with seafood and fresh cheeses. It shows nice concentration, fine balance and a lingering finish.",2014
US,Red Blend,90,19,Salida 2008 Tres Viños Red (Yakima Valley),Paul Gregutt,"This is half Tempranillo, one quarter Garnacha, one quarter Monastrell.

US,Syrah,94,110,Horsepower 2011 The Tribe Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),Paul Gregutt,"Floral aromas and tight raspberry fruit flavors are the first impression.

US,Chardonnay,89,55,Merryvale 1998 Silhouette Chardonnay (California),NA,"They took only the best fruit they could find for this expensive wine, and made only 1,280 cases of it. Using every Burgundian trick in the book, winemaker Steve Test has created a rich, creamy wine, long on smoky oak and yeasty lees, with impressive spice and fruit that veers toward peaches and more tropical notes.",1998
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,45,Seven Hills 2012 Klipsun Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),Sean P. Sullivan,"Coffee, herb, cherry, cocoa and barrel-spice aromas draw you into the glass. The palate brings down a velvet hammer with dense, brooding dark cherry flavors backed by tightly wound tannins. It has the stuffing to go the distance. Wait until 2021 or give it a day-long decant.",2012
Germany,Riesling,88,55,Baron Knyphausen 2009 Erbacher Steinmorgen Erstes Gewächs Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),Joe Czerwinski,"Lush and already highly enjoyable, with a round, creamy texture and lingering finish.

US,Sauvignon Blanc,89,17,Foley 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara),NA,"This big-bodied wine is full of smoke, toast and custard in the nose, sure signs of barrel fermentation or aging. The mouth is packed with thick, custardy citrus fruit, which renders it a bit like orange-tinged flan. Fortunately, it retains its acids, which keeps it well balanced despite the heavy oaking it went through.",2000
US,White Blend,88,13,Hedges 2007 C.M.S. White White (Columbia Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"This is almost two thirds Sauvignon Blanc, one third Chardonnay, and one percent Marsanne providing the ‘M' that completes the name.

Nothing wimpy about it, just great, lightly ripe flavors of citrus and stone fruits, without the crutch of oak.",2007
Austria,Riesling,92,NA,Bründlmayer 2011 Steinmassel Erste Lage Riesling (Kamptal),Roger Voss,"Made using fruit from one of the top Kamptal vineyards, this perfumed wine has great texture, with tight acidity and notes of green plum skin and lemon zest. With its depth of flavor and nervy, minerally edge, it will age for at least four years.",2011
Italy,Dolcetto,86,29,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2005 Vigna Tecc  (Dolcetto di Dogliani Superiore),NA,"Unlike most Dolcettos, this is laid back; it doesn't announce itself with a great blast of fruit. Instead it offers a package of spices and blackberry jam throughout the palate. No great intensity here but there is an easy elegance to the wine, culminating in a solid, medium finish.",2005
US,Zinfandel,86,35,Benessere 2009 Black Glass Vineyard Estate Zinfandel (Napa Valley),NA,"While this wine has Napa elegance, it never completely loses the varietal's rustic edge. It's rich in briary berries, cola, tobacco and white pepper flavors, and it comes with an overripe, raisiny sweetness.",2009
Italy,Prosecco,85,15,Zardetto NV Brut  (Prosecco del Veneto),NA,"This is a neutral wine with little in terms of aromatic intensity although it does not lack in definition. The goal here is to keep the palate refreshed as a before-dinner drink, and this well-priced sparkler definitely gets the job done.",NA
Austria,Riesling,91,48,Arndorfer 2008 Die Leidenschaft Riesling (Niederösterreich),Roger Voss,"Beautifully perfumed, this is now maturing.

Spain,Chardonnay,84,15,Enate 2014 234 Chardonnay (Somontano),Michael Schachner,"Waxy, weird aromas of lemon and ham are all over the map. This feels heavy, with a sense of sugary weight. Chunky flavors of cured pork and creamy melon finish plump but amorphous.",2014
Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,85,15,Indomita 2014 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Michael Schachner,"This is an overtly oaky Cabernet with resiny, balsamic aromas that share space with baked black-fruit scents.

US,Viognier-Valdiguié,84,17,Westbrook Wine Farm 2007 Viognier-Valdiguié (Madera),NA,"Fruity and easy, this soft wine has sweet flavors of apricots and caramel. Valdiguié, formerly known as Napa Gamay, is a red grape, and that accounts for the note of crushed raspberries.",2007
US,Red Blend,88,14,Three Rivers 2013 River's Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sean P. Sullivan,"Sangiovese, Malbec and Merlot take the lead on this blend. Red cherry, plum and red currant aromas are followed by tangy fruit flavors, with the oak seeming dialed back and a lingering finish. Pair it with pizza or a red pasta sauce.",2013
Spain,Red Blend,88,12,Can Blau 2010 Blau Red (Montsant),Michael Schachner,"This straightforward, perfectly clean blend of Carignan, Syrah and Garnacha would function as a great everyday house red.

France,Pinot Noir,87,40,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Laurent Dufouleur Château Mi-Pont  (Mercurey),Roger Voss,"This large appellation in the Côte Chalonnaise can produce fruity wines like this.

France,Sauvignon Blanc,90,23,Bouchié-Chatellier 2015 La Renardière  (Pouilly-Fumé),Roger Voss,"This is a perfumed crisp wine, attractively fruity and with delicious acidity.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,93,65,Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Lenuma Red (Douro),Roger Voss,"This Avidagos vineyard in the Corgo River Valley is one of the oldest in the Douro. The wine, from a parcel of old vines, is hugely powerful and dense. With its dark tannins, concentrated black fruits, it could be too much. Somehow it pulls back leaving a very rich wine but also one that has structure and final freshness. The wine needs to age and should not be drunk before 2020.",2011
Italy,Chardonnay,90,84,Ferghettina 2006 Pas Dosé Chardonnay (Franciacorta),Kerin O’Keefe,"Fans of no-dosage sparklers will appreciate this elegant, bone-dry wine.

US,Zinfandel,88,34,De Loach 2009 Riebli Valley Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma County),NA,"Even by De Loach's standards of enormously ripe Zinfandels, this one stands out. It's a hydrogen bomb of a wine, fantastically rich in berries and fruits that have a slightly dried quality to them. The tannins are thick, and the alcohol seems higher and hotter than the stated 14.5% by volume.",2009
Italy,Nebbiolo,88,100,Josetta Saffirio 2012 Persiera  (Barolo),Kerin O’Keefe,"Woodland berry, toast, sawdust, grilled herb and camphor are some of the aromas that emerge on this.

Australia,Riesling,90,38,Grosset 2008 Springvale Riesling (Clare Valley),Joe Czerwinski,"Like some of the other 2008s, this wine seems to be evolving rapidly—a common enough occurence in hot vintages.

Argentina,Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon,85,17,Ricominciare 2009 Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley),Michael Schachner,"One of the harder, more tannic wines from Argentina you'll come across. The nose has leafy, menthol aromas that are raisiny and rooty. The palate is like nails it's so tannic, while the flavors of cassis, prune and bitter chocolate are deep and good. Super tannic stuff.",2009

US,Chardonnay,93,45,Pellegrini 2013 Olivet Lane Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Virginie Boone,"Rich and creamy, this beguiling wine offers a counterweight of lightness and balance, finding as much lemon and lime zest as baked apple and pear within its layers of flavor.

France,Syrah,87,13,Laurent Miquel 2006 Nord Sud Syrah (Vin de Pays d'Oc),NA,"Appealing for its serious plum, barnyard, black pepper and licorice aromas. A bit simpler in the mouth, with some grippy tannins and just enough acidity to keep the dense, woodsy palate from feeling heavy.",2006
Chile,Merlot,85,11,Caliterra 2011 Reserva Estate Grown Merlot (Colchagua Valley),Michael Schachner,"Meaty, tarry aromas get reduced to simple darkness and shoe polish as this Merlot opens.

France,Gamay,87,19,Henry Fessy 2010  Brouilly,Roger Voss,"A wine with considerable structure, balanced by a good dollop of sweet fruits. The wine has weight, a tight final acidity and a finish that hints at some aging potential.",2010
US,Rosé,86,15,Koenig Vineyards 2012 55% Syrah-45% Merlot Dry Rosé,Sean P. Sullivan,"Medium cherry in color, this blend comes from a mixture of Williamson and the winery's estate vineyard. It's brightly aromatic with notes of cherry and strawberry, drinking medium bodied with good depth of flavors, though at times seeming a bit ponderous.",2012
US,Chardonnay,90,40,Minimus 2014 Dijon Free Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"A bit cloudy and still tasting as if it came right out of the new French barrels in which it was fermented, this offers a rich and diverse texture and highlights of lemon oil, beeswax and Aplets & Cotlets. There's a lot going on here, in a blocky chunky, fruity style.",2014
Spain,Rosé,87,12,Ochoa 2011 Rosado Garnacha Rosé (Navarra),Michael Schachner,"Strawberry and other red-fruit aromas run the bouquet. The palate is tangy and crisp, with dry but clean red-fruit flavors. Mildly spiced on the finish, this has length and purity. A very good quaffer.",2011
Georgia,Rkatsiteli,88,21,Doqi 2014 Qveri Rkatsiteli (Georgia),Mike DeSimone,"Light amber in the glass, this wine offers a bouquet of stone fruit and white flowers. It is round on the palate with flavors of apricot, peach, flint and white chocolate. Tannins that enter softly stiffen up just before the smooth, bright finish.",2014
Italy,Cortese,86,21,Marchesi di Barolo 2015 del Comune di Gavi  (Gavi),Kerin O’Keefe,"The nose isn't very expressive but eventually reveals whiffs of pressed white flower and orchard fruit. The straightforward palate offers suggestions of mature yellow apple, candied lemon drop and a bitter almond note.",2015
Italy,Red Blend,86,NA,Saladini Pilastri 2010 Montetinello  (Rosso Piceno),NA,"From the up-and-coming Rosso Piceno appellation on the Adriatic coast of Central Italy, this is a thin and informal red wine with fruity tones of strawberry and blueberry in the spotlight. A touch of sweet coffee or mocha appears as a distant accent on the close.",2010
Spain,Sparkling Blend,91,26,Muga 2013 Casa Conde de Haro Metodo Tradicional Brut Sparkling (Cava),Michael Schachner,"Brioche and buttered bread aromas lead the way on the nose. Malic acidity creates textural freshness, while yeasty flavors of green apple finish on an underripe nectarine note. Drink through 2020.",2013
US,Rosé,85,20,Eleven 2012 La Primavera Rosé (Washington),Paul Gregutt,"A pretty coppery color reminiscent of the rosés of southern France, this unusual blend of Mourvèdre, Syrah, Malbec and Viognier is done via the saignée (bleeding the tanks) method. Muted flavors of dried peach, banana and cantaloupe combine in an interesting way, but the finish has off-flavors.",2012
US,Pinot Noir,91,69,Rochioli 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),NA,"This is Rochioli's basic Pinot Noir. It's a beautiful wine, marked by great structure and accessible fruit.

US,White Blend,89,16,Bergevin Lane 2008 Calico White White (Columbia Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"The Calico White is one of the state's most popular white blends, and is moving step by step toward an all-Rhône effort, now 44% Viognier 37% Roussanne, and just 19% Chardonnay.

US,Rosé,88,22,Cass 2015 Oasis Rosé (Paso Robles),Matt Kettmann,"This GSM pink wine offers very inviting notes of fresh watermelon, strawberry, pink rose and slight bubblegum on the nose. With ripe strawberry flavors and a slight orange bitterness toward the finish, this is a perfect wine for sunny afternoons and beach days, if the slightest bit sweet.",2015
US,Pinot Noir,90,42,Seven of Hearts 2009 Special Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"Four vineyards provided the fruit, one third of which was fermented in whole clusters, creating a round, full-bodied wine with lush cherry fruit, streaked with vanilla. Nice spice notes from barrel aging, and a pleasing earthy character underscores the tannins.",2009
US,White Blend,90,16,Eight Bells 2011 Ravenna White (Oregon),Paul Gregutt,"This is a first-rate Oregon Pinot Gris made with fruit sourced from the Methven Vineyard. Crisp and steely, it's a mix of cucumber and honeydew melon fruit, with bracing acidity and excellent length.",2011
Italy,Nebbiolo,88,40,Collina San Ponzio 2012  Barolo,Kerin O’Keefe,"Here's a solid, straightforward Barolo that delivers aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, raspberry compote, star anise, leather and menthol.

US,Arneis,86,15,Enotria 2014 Uvaggio Isabella Arneis (Mendocino County),Jim Gordon,The floral aromas in this animated wine give way to fragrant fruit salad flavors that range from orange to pineapple to apple. It has a nicely tart texture and lingering fruity finish.,2014
US,Chenin Blanc,86,12,Husch 2014 Chenin Blanc (Mendocino),Jim Gordon,"This wine will be ideal for picnics, or to bring a little summer to the cocktail hour in the cold months. It smells like fresh-cut apples, tastes deliciously fruity and has crispness rounded off by a dash of sweetness.",2014
Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon,93,65,Salentein 2012 PR1MUM Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley),Michael Schachner,"This classy Cabernet marks a high point for Salentein. On the nose, it's redolent of oak grain, tobacco, vanilla and all sorts of berry fruits. The palate is full, ripe and solid as an ox. Spiced berry, tobacco and cedary flavors finish dry, sturdy and lightly herbal. Drink through 2022.",2012
US,Riesling,90,14,Viento 2006 Columbia Gorge Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Gorge (OR)),Paul Gregutt,"This is winemaker Rich Cushman's estate vineyard. At 25 years of age, it may well be the oldest Riesling planting in the region. The alcohol is just under 11%, but there is plenty of acid under the fruit, so despite its off-dry designation, this is a wine that would work wonderfully well with a wide variety of cheeses and appetizers. Flavors suggest pears and peaches, detailed with spice and stone.",2006
France,Chardonnay,83,14,Eric Louis 2016 Alphonse Dolly Les Doigts d'Or de Dolly Chardonnay (Vin de France),Roger Voss,"Soft, rounded and fruity, with apple flavors, this is pretty anonymous in character. Drink now.",2016
US,Pinot Gris,86,16,La Chouette 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"This small-production, estate-grown wine needs more time in bottle to lose some of the beery yeastiness it currently shows. Along with those strong flavors are lighter threads of yellow apple and grapefruit rind.",2013
US,Pinot Noir,87,36,Marshall Davis 2013 Beacon Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir,Paul Gregutt,"This young wine is already softening up around the tannic edges, and showing some early maturation of the plum and berry fruit flavors. A streak of mint and licorice runs into the finish, along with some not-quite-integrated oak tannins.",2013
US,Syrah,90,50,Carr 2009 Morehouse Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),NA,"This Syrah is considerably lighter in body than you'd expect for a variety that's often heavy and full bodied. It has the silkiness of a Pinot Noir, and it's dry and complex in wild berry, leather, black pepper and cedar flavors. It shows lots of elegance throughout, and could even pick up bottle notes over the next six years.",2009
US,Pinot Noir,88,45,Reata 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Virginie Boone,"A grippy Pinot Noir with a hint of menthol on the nose, this wine is otherwise delicately high in acidity with a burst of tart cherry that swirls between soft, round tannins and brambly blackberry on the finish.",2012
France,Sauvignon Blanc,90,27,Fournier Père et Fils 2015 Les Deux Cailloux  (Pouilly-Fumé),Roger Voss,"Like so many wines from the Pouilly Fumé appellation, this wine is very young at this stage. It shows pepper and only the beginnings of what will be intense white fruits, good acidity and rich texture. Drink from 2018.",2015
US,Viognier,86,20,Robert Hall 2011 Viognier (Paso Robles),NA,"There's ample acidity and just a touch of oak on this Viognier, which is rich in orange, peach and lime flavors. It finishes with some sweetness, but the acidity comes to the rescue, providing a clean, brisk close.",2011
Italy,Red Blend,87,NA,Le Grascete 2008 Grale  (Bolgheri),NA,"This 70-20-10 blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot shows loads of zesty pepper and green spice.

Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,25,Calcu 2013 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),Michael Schachner,"A full package of spice, tobacco and black-fruit aromas make for an attractive opening. This feels solid and dense, with grabby tannins that muscle out elegance. Lightly stewed berry and plum aromas are backed by chocolate, cola and molasses notes on the finish. Drink through 2022.",2013
Italy,Trebbiano,88,25,Perticaia 2009 Trebbiano (Umbria),NA,This bright Trebbiano from the beautiful Spoleto area of southern Umbria offers creamy peach and citrus aromas with a touch of dried hay at the end. The wine matures in stainless steel to lock in its fruity freshness.,2009
Austria,Rotgipfler,91,42,Johanneshof Reinisch 2011 Satzing Rotgipfler (Thermenregion),Roger Voss,"A single vineyard wine with the typical spice and richness of Rotgipfler, a rare grape found only in Thermenregion, south of Vienna. Just off dry, so soft and warm in character, it has ripe pear, lychee and kiwi fruit flavors. Ready to drink, or age another year or two.",2011
US,Pinot Noir,90,43,Thomas George 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Virginie Boone,"A moderate level of earthiness is found in this approachable wine, which is friendly and rounded in baked cherry, plum, cola and velvety smooth layers of texture. It pleases for its brisk acidity and integrated oak.",2014
France,Pinot Gris,92,29,Domaine Pfister 2015 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Almost tropical overtones on the nose announce ample pure fruit. Russet pear has both a touch of fresh Amalfi lemon and luscious honey. Yet the palate is slender, taut and dry. A lovely evocation of the varietal richness of Pinot Gris, framed on very light feet with elegance and poise. Totally appetizing, dry and moreish.",2015
Australia,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,35,Juniper 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),Joe Czerwinski,"Full-bodied, soft and a bit woody, this wine's smoky, hickory-scented aromas end up slightly dominating the fruit flavors. After 20 months in French oak, the fruit has taken on a dried character, ending on a cedary note. Drink now.  Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.",2003
Argentina,Red Blend,92,30,Finca Agostino 2008 Agostino Familia Gran Reserva Red (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"This opens with smoky, powerful aromas of black fruit and oak. The palate feels flush, offering several levels of character and complexity. Flavorwise, this pulses with blackberry, cassis and fudge, before finishing with subtle prune, mint and chocolate notes. Not edgy or hard. A blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot, Cabernet and Syrah.",2008
Portugal,Portuguese Red,84,73,Quinta de Arcossó 2008 Superior Red (Trás-os-Montes),Roger Voss,"New wood aromas give minty character to this wine. The palate is dominated by that wood, which covers the fruit and just leaves structure. Considering that the wine is now five years old, this imbalance will probably remain.",2008
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,93,80,Hall 2012 Ellie's Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Virginie Boone,"Blended with a healthy dose (21%) of Merlot, this luxurious, velvety wine is named for co-owner Craig Hall's mother. Blackberry jam, black pepper and a touch of thick tar mark the full-bodied deliciousness going on here, a totally pleasurable experience worth enjoying now, though it can be held through 2020.",2012
Spain,Tempranillo,88,25,Marques de Arienzo 1998 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),Michael Schachner,"Classic old-school Gran Reserva. The nose is full of barbecue, molasses and dried plum, while the palate has complexities in the form of tobacco, tire rubber and earth. It goes somewhat citrusy and quick on the finish, ending in a wash of orange-infused leather and chocolate. Drink now or hold for another 5 years.",1998
France,Malbec,85,13,Château de Gaudou 2014 Gaudou Exception Malbec (Vin de France),Roger Voss,"This juicy wine conveys a ripe black cherry and lightly spicy character. It's all about the fruit, right up front and with a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",2014
US,Chardonnay,90,30,Fontanella 2008 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),NA,"A lean, steely and slightly herbaceous Chardonnay, whose brisk elegance makes up for the absence of richness. This Chablis-style wine is marked by minerals and suggestions of lemons and limes, as well as strong acidity. Calls for fresh crab in the shell, with plenty of drawn butter for dipping.",2008
France,Bordeaux-style White Blend,87,14,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2010 White (Bergerac Sec),Roger Voss,"A richly opulent blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon. It is rich, almost too rich due to its low acidity, but with some attractive melon, green plum and peach fruits. The spice from wood adds interest.",2010
France,Bordeaux-style White Blend,86,15,Château Lauretan 2010  Bordeaux Blanc,Roger Voss,"Dominated by grapefruit and pineapple flavors, this is very fresh and herbaceous. The wine is crisp and clean, with acidity at the end. Drink over the next year.",2010
France,Melon,92,NA,Bonnet-Huteau 2013 Les Laures Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),Roger Voss,"The granite soil with its strong texture translates into a tightly woven wine full of spice as well as rich yellow fruits. It's complex, packed with acidity, touches of vanilla and a richly smooth aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",2013
France,White Blend,90,NA,Château d'Arlay 2008 White (Côtes du Jura),Roger Voss,"Although the wine is mature, it also has freshness that comes through strongly as aromatic and yellow-fruit driven. The acidity is intense, full of character while fruitiness continues right to the end.",2008
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93,NA,Château Giscours 2010 Barrel sample  (Margaux),Roger Voss,"92-94 Sweetly juicy wine, the new wood giving high toast to the black currant flavors. It is on the elegant side, although the new wood needs to be tamed to let the fruit come through.",2010
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,91,40,Januik 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),Sean P. Sullivan,"This appellation is best known for its power but this wine shows it can just as easily demonstrate subtlety and nuance. Coffee, milk chocolate and cherry flavors lead to a textured palate that shows a lot of polish and detail. It's impossible to take a sip without wanting to take another.",2012
France,Riesling,94,49,Domaine Zinck 2015 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Anne Krebiehl MW,"The tart but tropical charm of passion fruit plays around the nose before more zesty citrus notes become apparent. The palate is generous with juicy peach, yellow pear and citrus. The vein of lemon freshness at the core is totally seductive. While the palate is patently dry, the absolute juiciness of the fruit will get you, as will the clean but aromatic finish. Drink 2017–2027.",2015
US,Cabernet Franc,89,20,Lamoreaux Landing 2013 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Accents of vanilla, spice and coconut waft boldly from nose to finish on this lavishly oaked Cabernet Franc. There's plenty of concentrated red-cherry-preserve flavor on the palate too though, tinged by savory touches of herb and bramble. It's rich and full bodied with firm tannins bracing the finish. Drink now through 2023.",2013
Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,22,Marchiori & Barraud 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Perdriel),Michael Schachner,"A reserved, interesting bouquet of pine and black fruits isn't overdone or overly oaky. In the mouth, this Cab is powerful and muscular, with a creamy, rich texture. Flavorwise, it's heady and creamy, with blackberry fruit and peppery spice on the finish. Drink through 2017.",2011
US,Chardonnay,88,13,Barnard Griffin 2015 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas of yellow apple, pear and spice are light but enchanting. The tart flavors bring a lightly creamy feel, showing a sense of poise.",2015
US,Pinot Noir,87,22,Brandborg 2007 Bench Lands Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),Paul Gregutt,"A light and very pretty Pinot Noir, Brandborg's Bench Lands is also a value offering by Oregon standards. Slightly soapy and cherry flavored, it's a pleasant quaffer, with light hints of vanilla, smoke, toast and earth, all in proportion.",2007
Italy,Rosato,81,53,Tenuta del Buonamico 2011 Rosato (Toscana),NA,There's an odd note of jammy fruit and cherry tomato on the bouquet that is followed by disjointed notes of raspberry and pear. A touch of bitter almond appears on the close.,2011
Austria,Sauvignon Blanc,91,NA,Wohlmuth 2015 Kitzecker Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),Anne Krebiehl MW,"The faintest notes of sea-breeze conjure up lemony freshness on the nose of this spritzy, light-bodied and fragrant wine. The aromatic allure of citrus foliage and lime zest unfolds beautifully on the creamy, balanced palate and makes for grown-up fun.",2015
Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,17,In Situ 2006 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Aconcagua Valley),Michael Schachner,"A solid, somewhat generic Cab with sweet cassis and raspberry aromas as a greeting. The palate is a little candied but it rolls out tasty, dense red-fruit flavors. It doesn't sport much Cabernet typicity but it delivers ripe flavors and a smooth ride.",2006
Greece,Xinomavro,85,23,Vaeni 2004 Naoussa Grande Reserve Xinomavro (Naoussa),Susan Kostrzewa,"Violet, cigar box and smoke mark the nose of this distinctive Xinomavro. On the plate, spice, sweet cedar and clove give it a rustic but refined feel. Pair with aged cheeses or meat dishes for extra appeal.",2004
US,Syrah,87,25,Zaca Mesa 2008 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),NA,"A sweetly soft 100% Syrah, made for drinking now. It's jammy and forward in raspberries, cherries and mocha, with a dusting of pepper and cinnamon. Firm tannins provide a good grip in the mouth.",2008
France,Pinot Noir,91,70,Domaine Chevillon-Chezeaux 2014 Les Crots Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Roger Voss,This wine comes from a steeply sloping vineyard just above the town of Nuits Saint-Georges. It is richly structured and dense with plenty of ripe fruits and acidity. The wood aging has softened the young fruitiness to give a balanced and layered wine that will be ready to drink from 2018.,2014
Argentina,Chardonnay,89,46,Viña Cobos 2015 Bramare Los Arbolitos Vineyard Chardonnay (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"Dry grainy, full-force oak aromas are front and center, with spiced apple notes playing in the backdrop. This is scorchingly oaky, with about as much toasty new oak as any Chardonnay can handle. Flavors of burnt wood and resiny apple finish extremely woody.",2015
Germany,Riesling,89,20,Louis Guntrum 2012 Nierstein Bergkirche Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Juicy white grapefruit and lime flavors penetrate throughout this juicy, off-dry Riesling.

Germany,White Blend,88,10,Karl Josef 2011 Piesporter Michelsberg Qualitätswein White (Mosel),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Enticing, with notes of candle wax, spice and zesty lemon, this off-dry blend of Müller-Thurgau and Riesling is deeply concentrated with white peach and apricot flavors. It's weighty and rich in feel, with streaks of mineral that add delicate complexity to the finish.",2011
US,Pinot Noir,87,29,Navarro 2007 Méthode a l'Ancienne Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),NA,"The winemaker calls this a “more masculine wine: richer, bigger,” which almost understates the case. It's fruity to the point of bomb, offering an orchard of ripe red cherries, raspberries, red plums, cola and something tropically sweet, like red mango. It's all liberally enhanced with the sweet vanillins of oak. Almost too much of a good thing, but saved by brisk acidity.",2007
South Africa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91,20,Glen Carlou 2008 Grand Classique Red (Paarl),Lauren Buzzeo,"This blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Malbec, 14% Merlot, 13% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc offers a minty character that prevails among the intense black plum and berry aromas and flavors. Well-integrated, with a decadent crushed velvet texture and a long oak-kissed finish reminiscent of dark chocolate-covered cherries.",2008
Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,24,Lapostolle 2012 Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),Michael Schachner,"Big, bulky, ripe aromas of cassis and blackberry come with a hint of cedar and spice. This Cab shows a clampy, tannic mouthfeel and loamy, ultraripe flavors of blackberry and cassis. Fudge, mocha and blackberry flavors drive the finish on this ripe wine from a hot vintage.",2012
Italy,Sagrantino,94,55,Tenuta Bellafonte 2010 Collenottolo  (Montefalco Sagrantino),Kerin O’Keefe,"Forest floor, ripe black fruit, truffle, leather and balsamic aromas open this bold, concentrated wine. The delicious palate offers layers of blackberry, spicy plum, black pepper, cassis and savory herb alongside big, velvety tannins. It has balance and depth but it's still young and needs time to develop complexity. Drink 2018–2030.",2010
US,Pinot Noir,92,34,Williams Selyem 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),NA,"Although this is the least costly of the winery's Pinots, it's a lovely wine. Blending from a vast source of vineyards has given winemaker Cabral the ability to fill in divots of every kind. Gentle and dry, this rich, complex Pinot Noir has the elegance and style you expect from Williams Selyem.",2008
US,Pinot Noir,92,82,Goldeneye 2012 Gowan Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Jim Gordon,"One of the most ripe, opulent and unctuous of the Anderson Valley wines, this full-bodied bottling smells and tastes like cinnamon, cherries, milk chocolate and brown sugar, but not as sweet as that sounds. The texture is very broad and mouth-coating and the alcohol feels on the high side, giving a feeling of power with polish.",2012
US,Pinot Noir,91,60,MacMurray Estate Vineyards 2015 Winemaker's Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Virginie Boone,"This is a soft, approachable wine, rightfully representative of its roots in the heart of the appellation. Allspice, plum and rhubarb provide a heartfelt offering of baked flavor and spice, as mild-mannered acidity keeps the fruit components fresh and persistent.",2015
Canada,Vidal,92,31,Pillitteri 2013 Red Leaf Vidal (Niagara-On-The-Lake),Paul Gregutt,"Lush and lovely, this sweet treat is an outstanding example of the variety made as an icewine. Loaded with apricot, tangerine, peach and honey, it compensates for its sweetness with balancing acidity. One 375 ml bottle will easily serve four for dessert.",2013
Chile,Carmenère,86,20,Botalcura 2007 La Porfia Grand Reserve Carmenère (Curicó Valley),Michael Schachner,"Tomato leaf, red bell pepper and dry spice aromas overrun the fruit, and in the mouth it's rather tart and acidic for the grape type. Flavors of cherry tomato, red plum and green herbs are good but sharp, while the finish features oak in the form of vanilla. More fresh and tart than most Carmenères.",2007
Italy,Insolia,88,27,Cusumano 2013 Cubia Tenuta Ficuzza Insolia (Sicilia),Kerin O’Keefe,"Made entirely with Insolia, this opens with subdued aromas of tropical fruit and white spring flower. The bright, linear palate offers passion fruit, peach, nectarine zest and a hint of ginger alongside crisp acidity.",2013
France,Pinot Noir,94,42,Bouchard Père & Fils 2005 Beaune du Château Premier Cru  (Beaune),Roger Voss,"From Bouchard's home vineyard, this is one of their signature wines. In 2005, it has produced a luscious, fruity wine whose richness is only a part of its wonderful floating character. The ripeness of the wine is matched by its structure, which promises considerable aging.",2005
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,9,Washington Hills 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),Sean P. Sullivan,"Plum, herb and vanilla aromas lead to easygoing black-currant flavors. It provides a lot of easy drinking appeal.",2013
Italy,Sangiovese,91,125,Altesino 2009 Montosoli  (Brunello di Montalcino),Kerin O’Keefe,"This wine, from perhaps Montalcino's most famous single vineyard, opens with fruit aromas of black plum, black berries, cake spices and a whiff of new leather. The ripe, round palate delivers sweet black cherry layered with notes of chocolate and hints of vanilla alongside friendly tannins. While it lacks its usual complexity, it's juicy, delicious and extremely accessible. Drink 2015–2019.",2009
Italy,Red Blend,90,31,Tenuta H.Lentsch 2004 Palestina Red (Alto Adige),NA,"A blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot, this is a soft and lush red wine, with pretty aromas of cherry, blackberry, dried herb, spice and bitter chocolate. It has a smooth texture that's backed by firm, enduring structure.",2004
Germany,Riesling,89,28,Weingut Albert Gessinger 2015 Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Josefsberg Old Vines Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Crushed mineral and tart melon rind notes lend a crisp, slender tone to this medium sweet Riesling. Its spry, filigreed texture is accentuated by high-toned acidity. The finish is only moderately long but refreshingly citrusy.",2015
US,Pinot Noir,95,54,Merry Edwards 2009 Georganne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),NA,"This is a brand-new bottling from Merry Edwards. It's her first from Westside Road, which is warmer than her haunting grounds around the southern part of the valley. It's quite a promising debut. The wine is round, soft, charming and complex, with elaborate cherry, blackberry, licorice and cola flavors. It feels important and ageworthy. Drink now, with several hours of decanting, or cellar through 2020.",2009
US,Syrah,87,40,Liberty Lake 2011 Syrah (Red Mountain),Sean P. Sullivan,Unusual aromas of cocoa and green tea mochi lead to a creamy smooth palate. The oak plays a primary role.,2011
US,Pinot Noir,87,40,Cherry Hill 2006 Sweeney Estate Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),Paul Gregutt,"Despite the cartoonish label, this wine is rough and rugged, with a tannic authority that may mellow with bottle age. Spice, berry, currant and leaf all combine into a wine whose herbal side seems to be its strength.",2006
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,60,Kenefick Ranch 2008 Chris's Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),NA,"A bit high in alcohol, this has blackberry and mocha flavors that are overripe, veering into sweet-prune territory. Drink now.",2008
France,Gros Manseng,91,17,Domaine du Tariquet 2014 Premières Grives Gros Manseng (Côtes de Gascogne),Roger Voss,"Lightly honeyed, this off-dry wine is complex while also fruity. Intense flavor fills the mouth with spice, yellow fruits, pineapple and a touch of mango. The fruits are balanced by the more nuanced honey and spice character that is finished with acidity. Gros Manseng, a native grape of this region, is worth getting to know. Drink this delicious wine from 2016.",2014
Chile,Cabernet Franc,84,15,Chilcas 2005 Tierra Oscura Cabernet Franc (Maule Valley),Michael Schachner,"A real South American take on this French grape. The nose is savory and smoky, with deep berry and vanilla aromas. So far so good, but the palate turns tannic and astringent, with black fruit and fig flavors getting run over by the grating mouthfeel. A take-no-prisoners wine with a coarse edge.",2005
Italy,Red Blend,88,26,Argiano 2013 Non Confonditur Red (Toscana),Kerin O’Keefe,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with aromas of black currant, pencil shavings, toast and a whiff of pine. Notes of mocha, graphite and anise add depth to the black cherry core alongside chewy but astringent tannins that leave a drying finish. Drink 2016–2018.",2013
Spain,Viura,87,15,Sonsierra 2015 Barrel Fermented Viura (Rioja),Michael Schachner,"While this smells almost entirely like a barrel, the palate avoids being resiny and instead comes across as fresh and balanced. Oaky flavors are unavoidable, while melony fruit notes on the finish are dosed up with wood spice and a shot of freshening acidity.",2015

France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94,80,Château Pavie Macquin 2008  Saint-Émilion,Roger Voss,"An impressive wine, beautifully structured, never too powerful, very elegant.

Chile,Red Blend,86,25,San Pedro 2015 Sideral Red (Cachapoal Valley),Michael Schachner,"Overripe stewy aromas of tomato, baked beans and raisin raise a red flag of caution.

France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87,15,Château La Rose du Pin 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,Roger Voss,"As the tannins soften, this wine will become rich with generous fruitiness.

France,Chardonnay,93,150,Domaine Leflaive 2007 Sous le Dos d'Ane Premier Cru  (Meursault),Roger Voss,"While the wine does have richness, it's the mineral and citrus side that is coming through at this stage.

France,Gamay,88,20,Château de Raousset 2011  Chiroubles,Roger Voss,"Showing a mineral-driven structure and firm tannins, this is a Beaujolais that needs to age. Rich and juicy, its perfumed red fruits currently cut through the dry tannins.",2011
US,Pinot Noir,92,40,Harper Voit 2013 Strandline Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"The most affordable of Harper Voit's 2013 lineup, this deeply aromatic wine offers up a lush mix of rose petals and other perfumed floral scents, along with hints of rhubarb and cherry. Elegant on the palate, it's a poised and balanced wine that brings to mind the old line about Ginger Rogers doing everything Fred Astaire did, only backwards and in high heels. Here the dance includes ripe strawberries, cherries, flowers and a long, graceful encore.",2013
France,Altesse,90,19,Les Rocailles 2014  Roussette de Savoie,Roger Voss,"Rich and fragrant, this is perfumed with white flowers and lemon blossom. Apples, crisp pears and lime give a fresh and tightly fruity taste. The aftertaste is bright, while also rich. Drink now.",2014
Spain,Tinta de Toro,94,70,Maurodos 2010 San Román  (Toro),Michael Schachner,"This burly Tempranillo opens with an alluring blend of graphite, stony mineral, marzipan and ripe black-fruit aromas. The palate is lusty, giant and tannic, but not mean or fierce. Blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors end with café mocha and licorice notes, while tannic grab suggests aging this until 2015–16 and drinking through 2023.",2010
Spain,Tempranillo,84,21,Finca Constancia 2009 Parcela 23 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),Michael Schachner,"Opens with aromas of funky fruit, sweet spice and Band-Aid. The palate is heavy and kind of flat, with weight and richness. Tastes candied and herbal, with a sweet and syrupy finish that's sticky at first and then burns a little as it fades away.",2009
Italy,Nebbiolo,88,24,Damilano 2007  Nebbiolo d'Alba,NA,"Delicate fragrances of blue flowers, pressed violets, exotic spice and white pepper emerge from the nose of this Nebbiolo from the Langhe. The wine shares a lot in common with its big brothers Barbaresco and Barolo, including a firm tannic finish.",2007
Italy,Barbera,87,16,Castello del Poggio 2011  Barbera d'Asti,Kerin O’Keefe,"Here's a charming and fresh Barbera d'Asti with delicious cherry, raspberry and white pepper flavors. It's simple but well made, and is all about easy enjoyment. Pair this with mushroom risotto or hearty pasta dishes.",2011
Spain,Tempranillo Blend,85,15,Bodegas Franco-Españolas 2007 Bordón Reserva  (Rioja),Michael Schachner,"Fiery berry and cherry aromas emerge with a hint of milk chocolate. This wine feels high in acidity, with raspberry, tart red plum and spice flavors that finish with citrusy snap and grittiness.",2007
Italy,Red Blend,86,24,Il Borro 2011 Pian di Nova Red (Toscana),Kerin O’Keefe,This brooding blend of Syrah and Sangiovese has aromas of black berries and spice while the dense palate offers prune and black pepper along with oak and chocolate. The bracing tannins need time to tame while a lack of freshness leaves this flat.,2011
Austria,Grüner Veltliner,88,17,Dürnberg 2012 Tradition Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),Roger Voss,"Full bodied with a creamy texture, this is a ripe, pear-flavored wine. It has weight, richness and warmth that contrasts a crisp edge of citrus acidity. With just a touch of spice, it's made to be enjoyed with Asian food. Screwcap.",2012
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,89,45,One 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),Virginie Boone,"A 100% varietal wine entirely from Yountville, this presents a touch of herb and cedar on the entry aromatically, followed by a thickness of tannin that softens in the glass. Big-boned, it finishes strong in tobacco and coffee.",2011
Italy,Red Blend,89,30,Mangiacane 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Kerin O’Keefe,"A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino, this offers delicate ripe black-skinned fruit and cooking spice aromas. On the palate, ripe black cherry, espresso and clove flavors are framed by firm tannins. Drink through 2019.",2011
Portugal,Portuguese White,88,13,Quinta de Soalheiro 2015 Allo White (Vinho Verde),Roger Voss,"The name is not a Portuguese greeting, but a blending of Alvarinho and Loureiro, the grapes in the wine. It is a rich, juicy wine full of apricot, apple and pear flavors. It has just the right amount of tangy texture and refreshing acidity. The wine is fruity, perfumed and bright.",2015
US,Merlot,93,85,Elyse 2012 Hossfeld Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),Virginie Boone,"From a vineyard 1,500 feet above the valley floor in Soda Canyon, blended with 4% Cabernet Sauvignon from Morisoli Vineyard, this is a beautiful beast of a wine, concentrated in red cherry and plum as well as mocha. Nicely weighted with soft tannin and length, it's well made and should age. Drink now through 2020.",2012
Spain,Garnacha,87,9,Borsao 2014 Viña Borgia Garnacha (Campo de Borja),Michael Schachner,"Gritty plum and currant aromas are basic but fresh. Ditto the palate, which shows acidic scratch but not too much. Prickly lightly oaked cherry and plum flavors end with scratchy freshness, lean tannins and lasting berry notes.",2014
France,Chenin Blanc,90,17,Monmousseau NV Brut  (Vouvray),Roger Voss,The tell-tale touch of honey so typical of Chenin Blanc gives this wine its creamy character. That contrasts with the tight apple texture and nutty character that add complexity to this delicious wine. It is rounded and soft while having the freshest aftertaste.,NA
France,Rosé,86,10,Famille Laplace 2015 Aramis Rosé (Vin de France),Roger Voss,"This is a ripe, red fruit and caramel flavored wine. With its strawberry flavor, balanced acidity and touch of spice, it is soft and rounded yet finishes with a fresh touch.",2015
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93,NA,Château Talbot 2005  Saint-Julien,Roger Voss,"With its big fruit, and hearty tannins, this is a powerful, ripe wine, having great sweet blackberry flavors, a touch of smoke and a black fruit core. Round and opulent, this is a generous wine already.",2005
US,Pinot Noir,84,16,Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 326 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),NA,"Light in body and tart in acids, this bone-dry Pinot Noir shows modest flavors of cherry skins, red apple peelings and cola.",2010
Austria,Riesling,92,NA,Hiedler 2012 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Golden and restrained, this wine does not give too much away on the nose. But the spicily soft palate delivers with a brilliant, lemon-zesty acidity well couched in mineral midpalate concentration with an enduring finish.",2012
Italy,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",84,NA,Pietro Clementi 2005  Valpolicella Classico Superiore,NA,This Valpolicella shows a nice level of heft and density with ripe cherry and blueberry aromas. There's a slight tannic touch here and enough natural acidity to pair with cream cheese and chives on crackers.,2005
France,Sauvignon Blanc,92,25,Domaine Fouassier 2010 Les Romains  (Sancerre),Roger Voss,"The Romans made it to Sancerre, hence the name of this wine. The flavors are rich, with a mineral edge to the notes of green fruits, plums and greengages and a serious citrus core. With its structure, the wine needs to age for 2–3 years.",2010
Spain,Tempranillo Blanco,84,24,Bodegas Valdemar 2014 Inspiración Valdemar Alto Cantabria Tempranillo Blanco (Rioja),Michael Schachner,"Green grassy aromas are modest and watery. This feels oily, but with decent acidity. Oxidized flavors of stone fruits finish wheaty, bland and eggy.",2014
Austria,Blaufränkisch,92,29,Muhr-Van der Niepoort 2013 Samt & Seide Blaufränkisch (Carnuntum),Anne Krebiehl MW,"There is nothing obvious about this wine: everything is subtle and elegant. The nose holds back and the taut palate only unfurls slowly to show a floral, fruity wine that reminds one of crimson peony petals as much as of dark, juicy cherries. Yet there is nothing facile about this. It is the silky-smooth texture, however, that delivers the killer blow. A most sensuous, intriguing wine of great elegance. Little wonder: its name means silk and velvet",2013
US,Syrah,94,55,Golden Triangle 2013 Syrah (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),Matt Kettmann,"It's a good thing Garagiste Festival cofounder Stewart McLennan caught the winemaking bug. This delicious bottling shows black currant, plum, blueberry, fennel, lavender, vanilla and gingerbread spice on the nose. Elegant purple-flower elements kick off the palate, and then come waves of blueberry-chiffon cake, blackberry juice, sea-salt caramel and a touch of vanilla.",2013
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,88,15,Crimson Ranch 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),Jim Gordon,"This easy-to-love wine from the Michael Mondavi family has an obvious but attractive oaky character, from the abundant cedar and cinnamon aromas to the spicy nutmeg and cardamom flavors that bolster its red cherry fruit and medium body.",2014
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88,20,Château Tessendey 2012  Fronsac,Roger Voss,"This rich wine is full of berry fruits that are smoothed out by wood aging. It is still young, with a structure of tannins that gives a dry edge. That will soften to reveal the fruitiness of the Merlot/Cabernet Franc blend with its fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2017. The d'Arfeuille family is now in its fifth century on Bordeaux's Right Bank.",2012
US,Red Blend,90,35,Peace Water 2014 Grateful Red (North Coast),Jim Gordon,"This firmly built wine is big in flavor and bolstered by a broad layer of fine-grained tannins. It tastes like blackberries, cranberries and dark chocolate. This wine should improve and soften a bit after 2019.",2014
US,Merlot,85,12,ForestVille 2000 Sonoma Reserve Merlot (Alexander Valley),NA,"A Julia Roberts of a Merlot, pretty and innocent, maybe a little clueless. But who cares? It's fruity, dry, and fun, and even has some layers of complexity. Best of all, it doesn't cost too much. Drink up!",2000
Australia,Shiraz,90,38,Peter Lehmann 2004 Eight Songs Shiraz (Barossa),Joe Czerwinski,"Matured 18 months in French oak, this rich, velvety-textured Shiraz shows plenty of vanilla influence as a result. But there's also plenty of ripe blackberry fruit, and the overall impression is of a lush, fruity wine that would make a lovely steakhouse red.",2004
US,Chardonnay,91,49,Trisaetum 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"This young wine is packed with a mix of fruit flavors, including apple, pear, touches of citrus and other light tropical tastes. Compact and bound up tightly, it should be cellared for another year or so, and/or aggressively decanted. The lightly buttery finish is proportionate and lingers, suggesting that further development in bottle may bring substantial rewards.",2014
France,Pinot Noir,94,195,Domaines Devillard 2010 Domaine des Perdrix  (Echézeaux),Roger Voss,"This has all the elements—fruit, tannin, acidity and wood, with powerful weight and concentration. Let this age for at least eight years; this is going to be impressive.",2010
France,Provence red blend,87,13,Château Routas 2014 Red (Var),Roger Voss,"With a blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is ripe, with a tannic structure. There is fine, juicy acidity coming through the dry shell of this young wine. With another year, it will fill out and be ready to drink. Drink from 2017.",2014
Italy,Friulano,90,80,Borgo del Tiglio 2013 Ronco della Chiesa Friulano (Collio),Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with subtle aromas of white stone fruit, yellow flower and crushed rock. The structured, savory palate offers tangerine zest, yellow apple, lime and minerals. Toasted almond marks the close.",2013
US,Syrah,94,48,Rôtie Cellars 2014 Northern Blend Syrah (Washington),Sean P. Sullivan,"Cofermented with 5% Viognier, this perfumed wine brings aromas of green olive, stems, potpourri, blue fruit and moist earth. The palate is chock-full of layered boysenberry and earth flavors, earthshaking in their intensity, with a mouthfeel that only heightens the interest.",2014
France,Rosé,89,70,Château d'Esclans 2010 Les Clans Rosé (Côtes de Provence),Roger Voss,"Ripe, smooth and toasty, this has the feel and texture of Chardonnay. It is full and rounded, yet its acidity and red fruit character lend elegance.",2010
Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,83,10,San Nicolas 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley),Michael Schachner,"Gritty, herbal aromas of generic berry don't exactly draw you in. The palate on this rudimentary Cab is rather weak in structure, with herbal, slightly salty flavors of dry, generic berry fruits.",2011
France,Gamay,90,13,Louis Jadot 2014  Beaujolais-Villages,Roger Voss,"This Jadot is a combo of long-term contract vineyards and its Régnié Cru, demonstrating that knowing the terroir makes a difference. The blend shows well in this rich, full wine. It reveals ripeness—round and full of strawberry flavors from the 100% Gamay, with a tight layer of mineral acidity at the end.",2014
Spain,Sparkling Blend,88,14,Segura Viudas NV Aria Estate Brut Sparkling (Cava),Michael Schachner,"Mineral, lime and crisp apple aromas give it a precise, pure nose. And that same character exists on the palate and finish, where white peach, green banana and melon flavors are full and forward. Shows good concentration and quality for a large-production bubbly at this price.",NA
South Africa,Cabernet Sauvignon,91,NA,Etienne le Riche 2007 Cape Winemakers Guild Special Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),Lauren Buzzeo,"Winemaker: Etienne le Riche. Pleasantly herbal tones of fynbos, mint, licorice root and violet grace the black cherry and boysenberry fruit core of this wine. The medium-weight mouthfeel offers gripping but not overbearing tannins, with ripe black-fruit tones that flesh out the palate. Final notes of bittersweet cocoa, wood spice and a touch of tobacco linger long on the close. It's mature enough to enjoy now, though it should continue to age well through 2021.",2007
US,Pinot Noir,84,50,Loring Wine Company 2007 Russell Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Paso Robles),NA,"Shows good, rich flavors of currants, cherry and blackberry pie filling, cola, mocha and spices. But the mouthfeel is heavy, and the wine is a touch overripe. Now through 2010.",2007
US,Moscato,92,16,Uvaggio 2009 Moscato Secco Moscato (Lodi),Virginie Boone,"A stunning and unusual white wine out of Lodi made by Jim Moore, with tremendous aromatics of honeysuckle and melon and a genius balancing between sweetness and acidity. Grapes—technically Moscato Giallo—were harvested from the Bella Vigna Vineyard fully ripe but at low brix, allowing this bottling to maintain a very low 12% alcohol level. An amazing deal for a wine that jumps out of the glass, all bright and starry eyed.",2009
Chile,Chardonnay,83,14,Lapostolle 2014 Casa Grand Selection Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),Michael Schachner,"Fleshy vegetal aromas of squash and pumpkin lead to a flat palate. This tastes like zucchini and squash, with bitterness and wheaty flavors on a dull finish.",2014
New Zealand,Merlot,92,39,Villa Maria 2013 Single Vineyard Braided Gravels Merlot (Hawke's Bay),Joe Czerwinski,"This Merlot isn't as big or tannic as VM's 2014 Reserve, but it's close in quality. Cedary oak frames Bing cherry fruit on the nose, while the palate delivers a rich, creamy texture and additional complexity in the form of vanilla, licorice and raspberry. The long, velvety finish folds in hints of dark chocolate and espresso. Drink now–2025.",2013
Italy,Prosecco,89,19,Bisol NV Brut Crede  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),NA,"Great execution and delivery: This lively Brut layers on stone fruit, floral and mineral tones in well-measured doses. The mouthfeel is creamy and soft, gliding over the palate in an attractive and refreshing way.",NA
US,Cabernet Franc,87,75,Von Strasser 2005 Marcellini Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Diamond Mountain District),NA,"It's terribly hard to make an expensive, upscale Cab Franc that succeeds. The variety on its own tends toward cherry fruit simplicity. In this bottling, von Strasser has added Merlot and even Zinfandel to perk things up with dark stone fruit and tannic depth. It's an elegant, dry wine, but at this price, not in the same league as their fabulous Cabernet Sauvignons.",2005
US,Kerner,90,25,Sidebar 2015 Kerner (Mokelumne River),Jim Gordon,"An apple scent and crisp, fruity, lightly herbal flavors lend plenty of refreshment to this graceful, medium-bodied and unoaked wine. It has great acidity and a dry but not austere personality. Kerner is a cross of the German grape varieties Riesling and Trollinger.",2015
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,94,150,Pine Ridge 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Virginie Boone,"Cocoa powder is met by overfilling notions of wild blackberry and black cherry in this memorably textured and complex wine from the mountain. A smoothness on the midpalate roughs out the rockiness of the back tannins and fistfuls of supportive oak, finishing in a high-toned minerality that echoes volcanic soils and gravel.",2014
Italy,Sauvignon,86,43,Vie di Romans 2011 Vieris Sauvignon (Friuli Isonzo),Kerin O’Keefe,"Matured on its lees for eight months in barriques, this wine offers aromas of crushed tomato vine, evident oak and vanilla. The palate boasts cantaloupe and green melon flavors, along with vanilla and bitter wood sensations.",2011
Italy,Moscato,90,20,Marchesi Incisa della Rocchetta 2015 Felice  (Moscato d'Asti),Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of yellow stone fruit, chopped herb and white flower lead the nose. The savory creamy palate doles out juicy peach, candied nectarine zest, sage and mineral alongside a softly foaming perlage. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors.",2015
US,Chardonnay,91,55,Albatross Ridge 2013 Estate Chardonnay (Carmel Valley),Matt Kettmann,"There's great backstory and foresight to this coastal-influenced project, and this bottling promises a worthy future. Aromas of crushed white rocks, lemon blossoms and lanolin lead into a clean, tight and bright palate. Excellent acidic sizzle presents flavors of squeezed lime, pomelo pith and Asian pear. It's a vineyard to watch.",2013
US,Riesling,86,NA,Lamoreaux Landing 2011 Round Rock Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"The nose on this Riesling is lavish with scents of white florals, ripe honeydew and lavender. It's dry in style with pleasant peach flavors, backed by a bold mineral undertone. Finishes quite brisk.",2011
Chile,Rosé,85,13,Casas del Bosque 2014 Reserva Syrah Rosé (Leyda Valley),Michael Schachner,"The first-ever commercial rosé from this producer is dull in color, with briny, pepper aromas. The palate on this Syrah-based wine is chunky and generic in feel, while salty flavors of apple skins and citrus finish salty.",2014
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,58,W.H. Smith 2008 Purple Label Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),NA,"A little too soft for ageability, but a very delicious wine. Not quite in the league of the wonderful 2007, but offers rich, ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola and cedar, with all kinds of earthy, minerally complexities. Give it a firmer mouthfeel and the score would soar.",2008
US,Rosé,91,35,Domaine Serene NV R Dry Rosé (Oregon),Paul Gregutt,"The current edition of this nonvintage rosé is a blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Bone-dry, tart and tangy, it's a versatile, food-friendly wine, with flavors of tart citrus flesh and rind. A dash of white pepper marks the long, full-bodied finish.",NA
New Zealand,Pinot Noir,90,25,Mt. Difficulty 2011 Roaring Meg Pinot Noir (Central Otago),Joe Czerwinski,"Mt. Difficulty's Pinots have resisted the trend toward ever-softer textures, even in this, the winery's entry-level bottling. Instead, the wine is firmly structured. Savory, dark-skinned plum fruit is accented by plenty of briary spice. Drink from 2014–2020.",2011
US,Pinot Noir,93,50,Clos La Chance 2012 Erwin Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),Matt Kettmann,"Clove and sage combine with brisk raspberry and warmer strawberry fruit for a lively wine. Flavors of black cherry, gingerbread cake, eucalyptus and lingering black spice comprise the palate, which is booming with mouth-watering acidity and strong tannins. Drink 2018 onward.",2012
US,Sangiovese,81,19,Midlife Crisis 2005 Sangiovese (Paso Robles),NA,"Too sugary sweet, with jellied flavors of cherries and spices. More like a dessert wine than a dry table one.",2005
France,Pinot Noir,85,64,Jaffelin 2009  Chambolle-Musigny,Roger Voss,"A tight wine, this is dominated by acids, red fruits and firm tannins, and it's missing some of the richness of the vintage. It has a closed feeling, and it needs some months to develop, but this will always be dry.",2009
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,85,Ferrari-Carano 2008 PreVail Back Forty Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),NA,"Sourced from a vineyard high up in the Mayacamas, on the Sonoma County side, this wine is intense with mountain grown fruit. The palate is full of ripe black currants, mocha and plenty of toasty oak. The tannins, while soft and pliant, are penetrating. All indications are of a wine that wants time in the cellar. Drink from 2016 till well beyond.",2008
Australia,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89,125,Mount Mary 2010 Quintet Red (Yarra Valley),Joe Czerwinski,"This is a nice Bordeaux-style blend with pretty cherry and currant fruit and some cedar shadings, but lack the complexity of others in its style. It's straight forward, polite and restrained.",2010
US,Pinot Noir,90,50,Davis Family 2012 Soul Patch Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Virginie Boone,"Muscular in brambly black cherry and spicy cola layers, this lingers on the palate long after the initial sip. A fine example from what the Russian River Valley winemakers call the Laguna Ridge, a not-too-cool, not-too-warm section of the appellation with shallow Goldridge soils.",2012
Spain,Garnacha,89,26,Pagos Familia Langa 2011 Real de Aragón Centenaria Garnacha (Calatayud),Michael Schachner,"Flush, jammy, spicy, peppery aromas are good and fruity. This is full and tight on the palate, with hard tannins. Flavors of plum, berry, vanilla and wood resin finish with a pinched, rubbery feel. This needs food in order to soften the texture.",2011
Germany,Dornfelder,85,12,P.J. Valckenberg 2012 Dornfelder (Rheinhessen),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Blackberry and blueberry flavors are ripe on this easy drinking, off-dry wine. It's juicy and rich, but lifted by a spray of crisp red cherry on the finish.",2012
US,Syrah,87,37,a-non-ah-mus 2010 Alisos Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),Matt Kettmann,"This very floral and herbally tinged bottling shows fresh crushed thyme, black peppercorns, lavender and woody blackberries on the nose. The palate shows some of the same, but descends into a very purple Concord grape flavor.",2010
New Zealand,Pinot Gris,87,23,Huia 2007 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),Joe Czerwinski,"This is leaner and more citrusy than the majority of plump New Zealand Pinot Gris, but still offers plenty of interest. The apple and pear flavors are clean and precise, outlined by citrus and with a hint of stoniness on the finish.",2007
Italy,Red Blend,91,51,Mauro Veglio 2009 L'insieme Red (Langhe),NA,"A blend of Nebbiolo, Barbera and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is deeply concentrated, offering pretty aromas of cherry, spice and cola. The 40% Nebbiolo is definitely noticeable—thanks to the wine's delicate bouquet. The 30% Barbera adds to the soft finish.",2009
France,Gamay,91,25,Domaine Bertrand 2015 Les Déduits  (Fleurie),Roger Voss,"From sand and granite soil, this firmly structured wine has dark tannins as well as the more familiar red-cherry flavors of Beaujolais. As it develops, it will become rich and fruity, juicy with good acidity. Drink from 2019.",2015
Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon,84,25,Casarena 2010 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"There's a fine line between ripe and overripe, and this awkwardly toes that line with syrupy aromas and a sticky mouthfeel. Along the path are flavors of maple, fudge and stewed blackberry. A jammy, soupy, candied finish is apropos for a heavy, superripe wine such as this.",2010
Portugal,Portuguese Red,87,NA,Casa Santos Lima 2013 Eximius Red (Lisboa),Roger Voss,"This big, bold and fruity wine highlights the juicy quality of ripe Castelão. The tannins are just there, forming the base for the ripe red fruits and warm structure. It could do with just a few more months, so drink from late 2015.",2013
US,Zinfandel,85,18,Sausal 2005 Family Old Vines Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),NA,"Almost like an Aussie Shiraz, this is a big, bold, jammy wine, full-bodied in ripe blackberries, cherries, mulberries, milk chocolate and spicy pepper flavors. It's technically dry, but so filled with fruity essence, it has a honeyed finish.",2005
US,Pinot Noir,91,54,Foursight 2014 Paraboll Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Jim Gordon,"This very limited production wine is Foursight's most expensive offering. It smells like red cherries and cinnamon, tastes warm and spicy, and feels broad and velvety. While not quite as impressive as the 2013, it has a plush and welcoming personality that's difficult to forget.",2014
Italy,Sangiovese,89,20,Terre di Talamo 2007 Tempo Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),NA,"This wine shows dark spice, ripe fruit, teriyaki sauce and savory notes of black pepper and leather. It's a dark, penetrating Sangiovese-based wine that will pair with grilled meat or sausage.",2007
Spain,Tinta de Toro,92,80,Bodegas Fariña 2011 Gran Colegiata Campus  (Toro),Michael Schachner,"Char and wood grain are prominent on a smoky nose with blackberry and black-currant aromas. Intense tannins and layered depth make for a full palate, while this tastes ripe and toasty, with blackberry and chocolate flavors. On the finish, mild herbal complexity mixed with latent oak are stirring. Drink through 2026.",2011
US,Pinot Noir,91,85,Winderlea 2014 Legacy Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Paul Gregutt,"The Legacy estate reserve is a limited selection from the original mid-1970s vines. Fruit flavors of blue plum and blackberry are shot through with a streak of chocolate, from aging in 18% new French oak. Elegant and persistent, this will drink well now through 2025.",2014
Chile,Merlot,87,17,Santa Luz 2011 Gran Reserva Corte Merlot (Colchagua Valley),Michael Schachner,"Tomato, chili pepper, saucy notes and roasted berry and plum aromas give this a traditional nose. The body is rich and round, with an extra layer or two of structure and tannins. Flavors of baked, stewed berry fruits and herbs provide a salsa-like component, while dryness and herbal flavors drive the finish.",2011
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,91,50,Clos Pegase 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),NA,"This Cab is in a somewhat awkward state now, poised between fresh blackberry and cherry fruit and mature notes of dried fruits and mushrooms. That tension lends it interest. The grapes come from Calistoga and Carneros, which also gives a dynamic play between lushness and acidity. It's a fine, stylish wine for drinking now–2017.",2009
South Africa,Chenin Blanc-Sauvignon Blanc,85,9,Beau Joubert 2010 Oak Lane Chenin Blanc-Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch),Lauren Buzzeo,"With 2,000 cases imported, here's a value white composed of 80% Chenin Blanc and 20% Sauvignon Blanc.

France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91,NA,Château Moulin Saint-Georges 2010 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),Roger Voss,"90-92 Severe in character, the acidity driving dry tannins. A wine for aging, although the juicy aftertaste is delicious now.",2010
Italy,Red Blend,92,35,Renieri 2004 Re di Renieri Red (Toscana),NA,"Sweet cherry cola, root beer, leather, dried tobacco and toasted oak emerge from the nose of this blend of Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. The wine has a powerful center and refreshing crispness on the lengthy finish.",2004
US,Cabernet Sauvignon,89,18,The Leader 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sean P. Sullivan,"Light aromas of dark chocolate, plum, herbs, flowers and tropical fruit provide intrigue.

US,Albariño,89,24,Broken Earth 2015 Albariño (Paso Robles),Matt Kettmann,"Gravenstein apple, honeysuckle and jasmine aromas show on the relatively boisterous nose of this bottling from a large vineyard on Highway 46 east of Paso Robles. There is compellingly grippy texture to the sip, with ripe flavors of pear and honeydew melon. A salty acidity takes it to the next level.",2015
France,Riesling,90,22,Robert Karcher et Fils 2013 Harth Riesling (Alsace),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Bright, friendly and pure mandarin flavors make for a very appetizing, fruit-forward wine. The same friendly, sunny mandarin fruit fills the palate with its tension between citrus tartness and luscious sweet freshness. Bruised apple peel makes an attractive appearance on the lasting finish that concludes with lots of freshness.",2013
Chile,Merlot,85,10,Pacifico Sur 2007 Merlot (Curicó Valley),Michael Schachner,"Slightly herbal, but not so much so that the bouquet is off or unappealing. Racy and a little rubbery on the palate, with generic but solid berry and herbal aromas. Long, herbal and only mildly scratchy on the finish. Standard Merlot from Chile.",2007
US,Sparkling Blend,85,39,Gruet 2012 Gilbert Grande Reserve Sparkling (America),Fiona Adams,Aromas of lemon juice and graham cracker show on the nose and carry to the persistantly foamy palate. Additional notes of apple and orange peel offer some depth but fade quickly from unrelenting acidity.,2012
US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87,50,J. Lohr 2008 Cuvée PAU Red (Paso Robles),NA,"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, this complex wine offers layers of blackberries, black currants, blueberries and sweet oak. The tannins are smooth, and the acidity just fine. The overall impression is a little ripe and obvious in its appeals, but it does have a certain fanciness.",2008

France,Sauvignon Blanc,91,30,Domaine Fouassier 2014 Les Romains  (Sancerre),Roger Voss,"Grown on southwest-facing slopes, this is a ripe, full wine with a natural warmth as well as a mineral texture. It is still tight and needs to age with its gooseberry and herbal edge as well as more flinty, smoky background. Drink from 2017.",2014
US,Chardonnay,87,40,Artesa 2011 Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros),NA,"This reserve bottling takes the winery's basic 2011 Chardonnay and elevantes it with rich fruit and oak flavors.

US,Chardonnay,90,40,Bernardus 2010 Rosella's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),NA,"This shows the rich, ripe, opulent fruit that always accompanies the Chardonnays of this vineyard.

Italy,Sangiovese,90,55,Donna Olga 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with aromas of forest floor, truffle, ripe berry, leather, crushed blue flower and a whiff of herb.

Austria,St. Laurent,92,20,Johanneshof Reinisch 2013 St. Laurent (Thermenregion),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Intriguing notes of sandalwood and orange peel insinuate themselves on the pure red cherry fruit. The palate remains refreshingly slender, unadulterated and perfectly balanced. This is subtle and understated and thus allows the moody and mutable St. Laurent fruit to change its expression as constantly and quickly as stormy clouds.",2013
Portugal,Portuguese Red,92,40,Quinta de Ventozelo 2008 Grande Reserva Red (Douro),Roger Voss,"Dominated by Touriga Nacional, this impressive and concentrated wine has a powerful structure, dark tannins, black stone fruit and layered wood.

US,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,65,Jeff Gordon 2010 Leo Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Virginie Boone,"A rustic, 100% varietal wine from Corbett vineyard, Leo is soft and approachable. It's a wine to please a range of palates in its lushness of blueberry and black licorice.",2010
Germany,Riesling,90,36,Georg Mosbacher 2007 Forster Musenhang Spätlese Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),Joe Czerwinski,"Aromas of peach, lime and mineral make a first-rate initial impression, and are then followed by zesty citrus flavors that enhance rather than overpower the briny minerality. It's 13% alcohol, but maintains a wonderful balance of alcohol, acid and just a hint of sugar. Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",2007
US,Rhône-style Red Blend,92,36,The Withers Winery 2013 Mr. Burgess Red (El Dorado),Jim Gordon,"Imposing, concentrated and tannic, this Syrah-based blend needs time to mature and soften. It has vivid aromas and flavors of black pepper, clove, cranberry and dark chocolate plus an almost rigid mouthfeel from a thick underpinning of fine tannins. The distinctive flavors match the powerful structure, so it should age well. Best to drink after 2020.",2013
US,Pinot Noir,90,55,Small Vines 2012 Estate Cuvée Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Virginie Boone,"This cuvée is put together from several estate vineyards, most of them marked by low vigor and cool ridge-top climates.

US,Syrah,87,35,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2012 Syrah (Red Mountain),Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine doesn't entirely seem in harmony with aromas of tire rubber, coffee ice cream, herbs and barrel spice. The dark fruit flavors have a full feel but a bitter note that runs from head to tail distracts.",2012
US,Rhône-style White Blend,93,25,Treana 2001 Mer Soleil Vineyard White (Central Coast),NA,"From the northernmost vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands, a fantastically interesting wine.

US,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,90,Pride Mountain 2011 Vintner Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Virginie Boone,"This is a structured, fairly austere Cabernet fermented in stainless steel and then aged in French oak.

Canada,Red Blend,91,20,Cellar Hand 2012 Punch Down Red (Okanagan Valley),Paul Gregutt,"Principally Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this dark and smoky wine from Black Hills Estate Winery brings exceptional complexity to a more budget-friendly blend.

Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,17,Koyle 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Michael Schachner,"A bit on the heavy and stewed side, but good in terms of fruit content. The feel is rich, rubbery and tannic, while the flavors run toward medicinal, syrupy berry fruit and then a warm, lightly baked sweetness on the finish. Ripe and rugged Chilean Cabernet.",2007
US,Zinfandel,82,32,Wilson 2005 Ellie's Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),NA,"The official alcohol is only 14.6%, not all that high, but the wine has a hot, Porty mouthfeel. It also tastes of overripe raisins, and finishes with a burning, chili pepper quality.",2005

Argentina,Malbec,85,17,Bodega Margot 2009 Maula Oak Malbec (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"This is minty, crusty and frankly a bit harsh on the bouquet, where aromas turn charred and burnt.

Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,82,12,Cigar Box 2015 Old Vine Hand Harvested Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),Michael Schachner,Two samples of this Cabernet were tasted and both are reduced and smell like spray paint. A clampy tannic palate offers stewy black-fruit flavors in front of an overoaked finish. This lacks flow and doesn't seem entirely natural.,2015
US,Sangiovese,89,22,Deerfield Ranch 1999 Roumiguiere Vineyard Sangiovese (Lake County),NA,"A tantalizing  wine, at once rigid and austere, then yielding and generous. It's pale in color, with earthy smells of sun-warmed red brick, dust and an elusive hint of black cherry. Remarkably light in the mouth, like air, with silky tannins. Firm acids scream out for Italian food. —S.H.",1999
Italy,Chardonnay,88,24,Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro 2011 Wadleith Chardonnay (Alto Adige),NA,"Wadleith offers fullness and generosity with bright aromas of yellow rose and stone fruit followed by touches of almond and cinnamon spice.

France,Gamay,91,25,Richard Rottiers 2010  Moulin-à-Vent,Roger Voss,"Smoky wine, rich as well as structured. The acidity of the year is integrated into the structure, the firm tannins and juicy red berry fruits a balanced pleasure to taste.",2010
US,Chardonnay,92,50,De Loach 2008 Hawk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),NA,"A flamboyant, crisp Chardonnay made in the popular style of elaborately toasty oak and very ripe fruit, which combine to offer an almost pastry-like dessert taste.

US,Chardonnay,90,48,Kerloo 2015 Calling Club Exclusive Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (WA)),Sean P. Sullivan,"Fermented and aged in neutral French oak with full malolactic fermentation, the aromas are light, with notes of green apple and mineral.

Italy,Sangiovese Grosso,92,NA,Innocenti 2007 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),NA,"There's an exotic touch of Indian spice and teriyaki sauce upfront that later segues to bright cherry fruit, leather and tobacco.

US,Syrah,85,22,Consilience 2013 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),Matt Kettmann,"Leather, shaved cocoa, smoked beef and purple fruit show on the nose of this wine. The palate offers touches of savory soy and smoked meat, but is dominated by sour boysenberry fruit.",2013
France,Chardonnay,88,NA,Domaine de la Croix Senaillet 2008 La Grande Bruyère  (Saint-Véran),Roger Voss,"Soft, green fruited wine, an attractive mix of crisp fruits and weighty texture. There is a good bite of pepper and apple skin that develops as the wine opens up.",2008
Italy,Sangiovese,91,NA,Castelli del Grevepesa 2005 Riserva del Cavaliere  (Chianti Classico),NA,"Here's a bold and modern Riserva that exhibits both grace and power.

US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,95,95,Shoup 2007 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"Made by Long Shadows winemaker Gilles Nicault, this wine, along with the 2008 and 2009 vintages, were released together. This is the most mature—a five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend. It's a beautifully integrated, floral and dusty wine, with contoured, sculpted fruit. Plums and cherries dominate, with dustings of cocoa powder, coffee and a hint of hazelnut. The wine is graceful and profound, with superb length and finesse.",2007
US,Pinot Noir,87,26,Kessler-Haak 2016 Rose of Pinot Noir (Sta.

Sullivan,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Carménère, Malbec and Cabernet Franc offers aromas of purple fruit, green herb, clove, barrel spice and spice box.

France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89,12,Château de Costis 2011  Bordeaux,Roger Voss,"This is a full-bodied, structured wine full of ripe berry fruits, delicate acidity and soft tannins. There is a juicy element that offers freshness to balance the firm texture. Wait a year to drink this wine.",2011
US,Sauvignon Blanc,84,11,Columbia Crest 2007 Grand Estates Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"This tastes a bit over-cropped; the varietal character is there, but it's a pale rendition.

Spain,Tinto Fino,94,120,Dominio de Atauta 2010 Valdegatiles  (Ribera del Duero),Michael Schachner,"Black cherry, cassis and cola aromas are on the money and exact, with nothing overt sticking out. This bottling is strongly built, probably the most tannic of Atauta's 2010 single-vineyard wines, but it's not coarse.

US,Pinot Noir,81,15,Brotherhood 2005 Pinot Noir (New York),Susan Kostrzewa,"Subtle aromas of cherry and cinnamon spice are followed by an overly tart, acidic character on this wine from historic Brotherhood. Light and somewhat one dimensional, it does have a clean finish and its minerality will recommend it to food pairing.",2005
US,Muscat,84,13,Cuckoo's Nest 2014 Fizzé Early Muscat (Oregon),Paul Gregutt,"This lightly spritzy, sweet wine has the sort of orange flavor that recalls baby aspirin. There's an impression of artificality; the fruit does not come through with much freshness.",2014
Australia,Riesling,92,17,D'Arenberg 2015 The Dry Dam Riesling (McLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills),Joe Czerwinski,"Neither McLaren Vale nor Adelaide Hills are particularly known for their Rieslings, but this is a fine example.

Drink now–2025.",2015

Italy,Nebbiolo,84,75,Mauro Molino 2009 Vigna Conca  (Barolo),Kerin O’Keefe,"From the Conca vineyard in La Morra, this Barolo shows the uneven ripening that plagued much of this village in 2009.

Spain,Tempranillo,87,18,Casado Morales 2012 Nobleza Dimidium  (Rioja),Michael Schachner,"Dusty, rubbery berry aromas are peppery and scratchy.

US,Pinot Noir,86,13,Castle Rock 2013 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),Jim Gordon,"The color is slightly light, the aromas are moderately spicy, and flavors recall baked cherries and plums.

Italy,White Blend,87,55,Fattoria Le Pupille 2005 Solalto White (Maremma),NA,"Solalto is a pretty dessert wine with a dark amber color and simple aromas of toasted almond, apricot honey, pine nut and maple syrup.

US,Chardonnay,95,60,The Eyrie Vineyards 2015 Original Vines Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),Paul Gregutt,"From Draper clone vines planted in 1965, this bright gold-hued wine brings myriad details to its apple, jicama, white peach and nut oil flavors. A whiff of smoke carries throughout, and its sheer complexity strains the vocabulary. Stay with it as more subtle layers unfold. Though seductive now, it should mature well through 2030.",2015
Spain,White Blend,88,15,Mustiguillo 2014 Mestizaje White (Spain),Michael Schachner,"Dusty, minerally, stony aromas come with a floral note and accents of peach and melon.

Italy,Sauvignon,86,15,Comelli 2014 Sauvignon (Friuli Colli Orientali),Kerin O’Keefe,"Subtle aromas of tomato vine, chopped herb and gooseberry set the tone while the lean, direct palate offers white grapefruit, yellow bell pepper a saline note. Bracing acidity gives it a crisp finish.",2014
France,Pinot Noir,88,80,Manuel Olivier 2011 Premier Cru  (Pommard),Roger Voss,"While this wine certainly has a tannic background, it is already showing fruitiness and ripe berry and red plum flavors. That makes for a warm, rounded wine that will age relatively quickly. Drink from 2016.",2011
US,Rosé,88,25,Horton 2014 Private Reserve Nebbiolo Rosé (Virginia),Alexander Peartree,"Northern Italian red grapes don't often turn up in Virginia. Electric pink in color, this saignée of Nebbiolo is all fruit. Fresh peach and strawberry mingle with juicy watermelon on a palate of ample weight and structure.

US,Chardonnay,85,40,Inception 2010 Origin Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),NA,"Lots of oak in this wine. With buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, it overpowers the underlying orange and lemon fruit, which isn't strong enough to stand up under all that wood.",2010

Italy,Nebbiolo,88,75,Marziano Abbona 2012 Ravera  (Barolo),Kerin O’Keefe,"Camphor, menthol, toast and espresso aromas lead the nose. The firm, tightly wound palate shows roasted coffee bean, dried cherry and licorice alongside bracing tannins.",2012
Portugal,Alvarinho,91,35,Quinta de Soalheiro 2013 Reserva Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),Roger Voss,"A wood-fermented and -aged wine, this tones down the fruity freshness of Alvarinho and instead brings out a smooth, toasty and ripe character.

Portugal,Portuguese Red,88,NA,Ramos-Pinto 2008 Duas Quintas Red (Douro),Roger Voss,"A broad, ripe and very accessible wine. Spiced by nutmeg and vanilla, it is based on solid, chunky black fruits and distinguished layer of tannins. Ready to drink, or keep for one year.",2008

France,Gewürztraminer,94,42,Domaines Schlumberger 2014 Kessler Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),Anne Krebiehl MW,"A touch of quince plays about the rich notes of peach and tangerine on the nose. An aromatic notion of dark fir honey leads onto a medium-sweet palate of ripe peach, zesty tangerine peel, golden mirabelles and lemon. The citrus elements provide a high-toned brightness that works very well with the sweet juiciness and richness of the palate. On the palate it is the wonderfully aromatic zestiness that lasts and lasts.",2014

France,Chardonnay,89,60,Huré Frères 2009 Inattendue Blanc de Blancs Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),Roger Voss,"Extra Brut, yes, but the ripeness of the Chardonnay gives a rich, creamed apple character that balances the very dry aftertaste.

US,Pinot Noir,90,45,Wölffer 2013 Landius Pinot Noir (Long Island),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Equal parts fruity and savory, luscious and composed, this full-bodied Pinot Noir offers keen balance in a satisfying package. Fleshy black-cherry and plum flavors are concentrated without seeming jammy. Nuances of mushroom, cedar, toast and spice are harmonious, lifted by brisk acidity and a frame of soft, filigreed tannins. It's lovely now but should continue to improve through 2025.",2013

France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,96,1200,Château Haut-Brion 2009  Pessac-Léognan,Roger Voss,"Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year.",2009
US,Cabernet Franc,87,23,Lovingston 2012 Josie's Knoll Cabernet Franc (Monticello),NA,"Scents of raspberries, flowers and exotic spices take the lead. The palate feels broad and untethered, featuring glossy tannins, balanced acids and a pliable finish.",2012
Spain,Tempranillo,89,25,Ramirez de la Piscina 2011 Selección Reserva  (Rioja),Michael Schachner,"A heavily charred opening emphasizes surface-level oak and baking spices more than fruit. A heavy, jabbing, grabby palate tastes herbal, with stewed berry and prune flavors. A burnt-oak flavor and severe tannins are found on the finish of this muscled-up Tempranillo. Drink through 2020.",2011
US,G-S-M,86,46,Workman Ayer 2010 de facto G-S-M (Central Coast),NA,"A very flavorful wine, rich in blackberry jam, chocolate, white mint and buttercream. The tannins on this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvedre blend are thick and soft.",2010
US,Red Blend,90,35,Silver 2009 I Tre Figli Red (Santa Barbara County),Matt Kettmann,"This powerful blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc by longtime urban winemaker Benjamin Silver comes together in a big way. Aromas recall rosemary-crusted beef, boysenberry, sweet tar and, thanks to the oak-aging, both caramel and vanilla. The rich palate shows black cherry, black raspberry and a pinch of tarragon.",2009
Italy,Nebbiolo,87,50,Renato Ratti 2010 Marcenasco  (Barolo),Kerin O’Keefe,"This wine begins with aromas of oak, coffee bean and toast. The palate lacks fruit richness, offering instead dried tobacco leaf, oak extract, espresso, dried sage, vanilla and mocha alongside bitterly astringent tannins.",2010
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93,NA,Château Pavie Decesse 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),Roger Voss,"92–94. Barrel sample. The diminutive neighbor of Château Pavie, Pavie Decesse's wine has its own, more mineral, tight character.

US,Red Blend,91,39,Joseph Carr 2012 Red (Rutherford),Virginie Boone,"Soft, structured and grippy, this lovely blend will serve well both at the table and with a crowd. It's pleasing in its elegant concentration of ripe red cherry and peppery plum.",2012
US,Sangiovese,87,15,Pedroncelli 2008 Alto Vineyards Sangiovese (Dry Creek Valley),NA,"This is one of the more drinkable Sangioveses in California, and while it's no blockbuster, it does have a certain charm. Dry and balanced, it has easy to like cherry, tobacco, bacon and spice flavors.",2008
US,Rhône-style Red Blend,90,25,Chesebro 2013 Las Arenas Red (Arroyo Seco),Matt Kettmann,"Black raspberry, blackberry, lavender and pepper show on the deeply purple nose of this blend of 67% Grenache and 33% Syrah. Dense black fruit shows first on the palate, followed by a zesty explosion of acidity, flowery spices and cola.",2013
US,Chardonnay,86,27,Ici/La-Bas 2007 Elke Vineyard Chardonnay (Anderson Valley),NA,"Eccentric, with sweet and sour tangerine, banana and buttered toast flavors. Crisp acidity provides balance, but the wine is nearing the end of its useful period.",2007
Germany,Riesling,94,60,Maximin Grünhäuser 2015 Abtsberg Auslese Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel),Anna Lee C. Iijima,"There's a marked tropical richness (think guava and melon) here compared to the producer's other 2015 ausleses. Plump and plush despite it's dainty alcoholic footprint, it lingers lusciously while remaining pert with acidity. Brilliantly balanced and irresistibly sweet, it can be enjoyed now through 2040.",2015
US,Pinot Noir,93,47,Marimar Estate 2008 Stony Block Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),NA,"The winery has been producing more and more low-production block bottlings from their estate vineyard. This one is entirely from the Dijon clone 115. It's soft, sweet and utterly captivating, a feminine wine of enormous charm, with raspberry, cola and pomegranate flavors, enhanced, of course, by smoky new oak. The acidity is fine, and will protect the wine as it develops over the next six years.",2008
US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94,55,Pirouette 2010 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"Pirouette is a Cabernet-dominated Bordeaux-style blend, with 31% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot completing the mix. Scents of violets and raspberries lead on the bouquet, with plenty of rich new-oak aromas. It's bright and spicy in the mouth, youthful and balanced, with terrific energy and aging potential.",2010
Spain,Tempranillo,87,9,Bocopa 2014 Alcanta Tempranillo (Alicante),Michael Schachner,"Perfumed plum and red-berry aromas are welcoming. Like most of the Bocopa wines, this is fresh and simple, with easy drinkability. Plum and berry flavors may rank as standard, but this Tempranillo is well executed as well as long and juicy on the finish.",2014
France,Pinot Noir,87,26,Patient Cottat 2010 Anciennes Vignes  (Sancerre),Roger Voss,"With its light color, this is a soft and fruity wine that is now beginning to mature.

Argentina,Bonarda,85,19,Valle de la Puerta 2008 Reserva Bonarda (Famatina Valley),Michael Schachner,"Tight berry aromas lead the way, followed by a lively but aggressive palate with jammy, sweet, candied berry flavors. Turns a little syrupy and sweet on the finish, but overall it succeeds in a generic sort of way.",2008
US,Viognier,87,30,Merrill Cellars 2011 Reserve Viognier (Oregon),Paul Gregutt,"This spent 18 months in neutral American oak, and has a strong woody scent and flavor. Light melon and cucumber fruit remains somewhat buried, and the mouthfeel is soft and diffuse. Drink up.",2011
New Zealand,Pinot Noir,91,40,Greywacke 2013 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),Joe Czerwinski,"The 2013 vintage was a solid one for Pinot Noir in just about every corner of New Zealand.

France,Chardonnay,88,56,Pierre André 2008 Le Rognet Premier Cru  (Ladoix),Roger Voss,"A severe wine, its structure deriving from an important wood element and fruit tannins. It brings out apple and green plum skins, with a tangy texture that demands a few months aging.",2008
Canada,Cabernet Franc,91,34,Burrowing Owl 2014 Cabernet Franc (Okanagan Valley),Paul Gregutt,"This pure varietal bottling spent 18 months in oak, emerging perfectly proportioned with deftly integrated flavors of berry and herb, and a touch of fresh snap peas.

US,Claret,84,48,White Rock Vineyards 2013 Claret (Napa Valley),Virginie Boone,"This is made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, with sizable additions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Mint and bay leaf curry favor on the nose, while a severity of oak hits the palate.",2013
France,Riesling,92,25,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2011 Riesling (Alsace),Roger Voss,"Here is a wine that is slowly developing the most beautiful flavors. It is so perfumed with a waft of white flowers that translates onto the palate. It's balanced by a firm, steely character and layer upon layer of acidity. Age this wine and don't drink before 2017.",2011
US,Chardonnay,89,22,Adelsheim 2010 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"Fine balance is a hallmark for all Adelsheim wines. This shows a mix of citrus and apple fruit, with the tartness of gooseberries as a nod to the cooler vintage. There is some pleasing complexity, with an emphasis on herbs and high-acid fruits.",2010
France,Pinot Noir,90,75,Michel et Joana Ecard 2014 Aux Serpentières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Roger Voss,"Rather lean and austere, this is a tight, structured wine. Its future lies in the firm tannins and the juicy red-currant fruit. Wait for this wine and don't drink before 2020.",2014
Australia,Cabernet Sauvignon,88,11,Jacob's Creek 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa Valley),NA,"Deep cassis aromas, a touch of licorice, and menthol notes on the nose open to a palate of black-currant and cocoa flavors in this well-balanced, medium-weight wine.

Portugal,Touriga Nacional,88,27,Adega de Penalva 2009 Touriga Nacional (Dão),Roger Voss,"Touriga Nacional is even more at home in the Dão than it is in the Douro.

France,Rosé,87,17,Domaine de Nizas 2010 Rosé (Coteaux du Languedoc),Lauren Buzzeo,"Composed of 40% Syrah, 40% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre, this fruit-forward rosé offers powerful notes of ripe red berries framed with a candied orange peel and watermelon sweetness. Fleshy on the palate with a full texture and body.",2010
US,Syrah,90,32,Mill Creek 2005 Corner Pocket Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),NA,"To judge by the blast of white pepper and strong tannins, the Northern Rhône is the model for this dry, single-vineyard wine. It is a distinguished Syrah, but too tannic and closed down now for thorough enjoyment. Best to cellar for 3 or 4 years, maybe longer, until it throws some sediment.",2005
France,Rosé,90,22,Château Maupague 2012 Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire),Roger Voss,"Vineyards around Mont Sainte-Victoire have their own appellation, accorded because of the extra ripeness the wines often have. This ripe, full, strawberry flavored wine has a fine balance between its crisp acidity and the ripe, warm texture. It could age for a few more months.",2012
France,Riesling,92,48,Domaine Zinck 2011 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Roger Voss,"Floral aromas lead into a rich, not quite dry wine that is beautifully ripe and perfumed.

US,Zinfandel,84,34,Mazzocco 2013 Sullivan Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),Virginie Boone,"This hyper-ripe wine hits it hard in terms of power and sheer strength of fruit, making for a big, slightly sweet and one-dimensional experience bordering on Port. It's to be enjoyed carefully.",2013
Italy,Sagrantino,90,35,Di Filippo 2009 Etnico  (Sagrantino di Montefalco),Kerin O’Keefe,"This high octane offering opens with aromas of mature black fruit, spice and orange peel. The palate expresses lush black cherry, blackberry and clove uplifted by a note of thyme alongside a seriously tannic backbone. It's shy on fresh acidity and you can definitely detect the alcohol, but it's still delicious.",2009
Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,90,25,Viña Requingua 2007 Potro de Piedra Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc (Curicó Valley),Michael Schachner,"A classic Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon with aromas of lemon peel, olive and leafy fruit.

Crisp acidity lends a clean finish.",NA
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,84,15,Château Saint-Urbain 2011  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,Roger Voss,"This dry wine is strongly dominated by tannins. It is structured, firm and hard-edged. Without the fresh acidity at the end, it would be a tough proposition.",2011
US,Chardonnay,85,11,Gnarly Head 2009 Chardonnay (California),NA,"Good and dry, with a firm scour of acidity and an earthiness to the pineapples and pears. This is a fine everyday Chardonnay at a fair price.",2009
Italy,Prosecco,84,29,Varaschin NV  Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze,NA,The wine opens with a slightly copperish hue and offers flat aromas of dried apricot and banana chips. Its mouthfeel lacks vibrancy and there are sour almond notes on the finish.,NA

Italy,Inzolia,86,NA,Tasca d'Almerita 2009 Sallier de la Tour Inzolia (Sicilia),NA,Inzolia is one of the most widely planted varieties in Sicily and the results are surprisingly consistent. The grape is usually vinified in stainless steel to lock in its freshness and lemon-lime aromas. This wine faithfully follows suit.,2009
Italy,Garganega,88,18,Coffele 2011 Cà Visco  (Soave Classico),NA,There's a lot of personality here that gives this Soave Classico a clear competitive advantage in the vast world of Italian white wine. That extra thickness in the mouth and that extra peach and melon aromatic intensity makes this a perfect choice for white meat or salt water fish.,2011
France,Pinot Noir,87,35,Domaines Devillard 2014 Domaine de la Ferté  (Givry),Roger Voss,This is an attractive red-fruit flavored wine with fine acidity as well as juicy berries and cherry. Its soft tannins are just right to sustain the delicious fruitiness. Dink this wine from 2017.,2014

Chile,Syrah,88,20,Viña Pérez Cruz 2010 Limited Edition Syrah (Maipo Valley),Michael Schachner,"This big, jammy Syrah from the Maipo Alto is typically leathery and spicy smelling. The body on this wine is fat and weighty, while flavors of buttery oak and spiced berry meld together if given time in the glass. On the finish, this is oaky and herbal tasting, with a creamy feel.",2010
Chile,Red Blend,88,40,Santa Ema 2007 Catalina Red (Peumo),Michael Schachner,"Smoky, rubbery and sweet on the nose, with mocha and caramel shadings. The palate, however, is more tight and narrow; the feel is fresh and blazing, while the flavors are piercing and suggest red fruits like cranberry and cherry. Citric but with just enough weight to register as true Cabernet (with 18% Carmenère and 7% Cab Franc).",2007
US,Chardonnay,92,54,Brewer-Clifton 2012 Gnesa Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),Matt Kettmann,"Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton's shared vision for this popular grape is distinctive and rather unfamiliar for those seeking a buttery style. This shows chamomile, dandelion greens, Japanese pear and petrol on the nose, with bittery flavors of grapefruit pith, lemon juice and nectarine skins showing first. Patience allows wet wool, stone, sliced apples and white peach elements to emerge. Drink 2017–2027.",2012
US,Pinot Noir,89,45,Les Belles Collines 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),NA,"This is an interesting wine for its earthy mushroom and tea flavors accenting a backdrop of strawberry jam.

Austria,Zweigelt,92,25,Netzl 2015 Rubin Carnuntum Zweigelt (Carnuntum),Anne Krebiehl MW,"This wine's nose is still closed, but its palate presents velvety, cinnamon- and vanilla-tinged black cherry fruit. The tannic structure acts like a velvet grip around its pleasantly fruit-dense core. That richness is countered by freshness in a package that's sure to give lots of pleasure through 2022.",2015
Australia,Shiraz,93,38,Chapel Hill 2012 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Joe Czerwinski,"This winery uses ample amounts of oak, but in years when the fruit concentration matches that intensity the wines can be compelling. Cedar and vanilla notes frame blackberry and cassis fruit in this firmly structured wine that folds in savory notes of roasted beef and black olive on the finish. Drink 2020–2030.",2012
US,Chardonnay,86,50,Trefethen 2010 Harmony Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District),NA,"This ambitious effort from Trefethen was grown in a block of the estate vineyard. No effort was spared, with careful clonal selection, tasteful oak application and all the bells and whistles of Burgundian technique. The result, however, leaves something to be desired. There's a taste of green pea lurking in the background behind the tropical fruit, green apple and peach flavors that must be due to the unusually chilly vintage.",2010
Italy,Sangiovese,87,25,Tenuta La Viola 2013 P. Honorii Bertinoro Riserva Sangiovese (Romagna),Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of espresso, black-skinned fruit and a whiff of toasted oak take center stage on this.

France,Chardonnay,92,36,Romain Bouchard 2010 Vau de Vey Premier Cru  (Chablis),Roger Voss,"Steely, minerally and very textured, this has concentratio and taut layer of acidity to go with the lime fruit. Powered by its structure, it will age for 3–4 years.",2010
US,Gewürztraminer,90,17,Thomas Fogarty 2006 Gewürztraminer (Monterey County),NA,"The best Fogarty Gewürz ever.

France,Chardonnay,89,100,Pierre Moncuit 1996 Non-Dosé Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),Roger Voss,"Very intense, very nervy wine, living on a thin wire of grapefruit and other citrus flavors but much more about pure structure. The aftertaste shows great concentration.",1996
Austria,Grüner Veltliner,88,13,Markus Huber 2016 Hugo Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),Anne Krebiehl MW,"This wine's nose suggests fresh lemon. The palate adds green pear to that citrus notion, providing a light, zippy, easy-drinking body with a clean, dry finish.",2016
France,Riesling,92,23,Domaine Charles Baur 2015 Cuvée Charles Riesling (Alsace),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Delightful peachy notes define the fruity friendly nose.

US,Cabernet Blend,85,60,Charles Krug 2012 Family Reserve Generations Red (Napa Valley),Virginie Boone,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot is quite sizable on the palate.

Austria,White Blend,89,NA,Schwarz Wein 2014 White (Burgenland),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Vanilla, ripe pear and cinnamon touches appear on the nose of this wine. That cinnamon impression becomes stronger on the palate, where it frames yellow apple and pear fruit.

South Africa,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,13,Helderberg Wijnmakerij 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),Lauren Buzzeo,An easy and approachable quaff with standard notes of cassis and black plum throughout.

Argentina,Red Blend,89,25,Alta Vista 2008 Atemporal Red (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.",2008
Austria,Riesling,95,48,Malat 2015 Silberbichl Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),Anne Krebiehl MW,"A subdued nose has the gentle lift of lemon oil and fresh lemon zest. The palate confirms all of this rich freshness, which streams with great direction across the palate. This is taut and concentrated, with a poised freshness and structure that holds very rich lemon and tangy citrus at its core. There is so much drive and direction. The lovely long finish is reminiscent of Seville orange and pink grapefruit.",2015
France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94,NA,Château Ormes de Pez 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Estèphe),Roger Voss,"93–95. Barrel sample. This powerful wine is dense with rich tannins and black fruits that are balanced. Full and concentrated, it's a wine with great potential.",2012

Portugal,Portuguese Red,89,10,Alente 2009 Trincadeira-Aragonez Red (Alentejo),Roger Voss,"An elegant wine that slides easily over the palate.

Michelle's mainstay Cabernet, rich and round, with a sophisticated mix of grapes, including Malbec, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah. Dark fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis create a lush center, and the wine is more evolved and smoother, with less obvious oak and barrel flavor, than the pricier Cabs from Ste. Michelle.",2009
Spain,Tinto Fino,92,25,Valderiz 2011 Valdehermoso Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),Michael Schachner,"Pure cherry, blackberry and plum aromas are dense, toasty, minerally and smoky.

Rita Hills),Matt Kettmann,"Red apple aromas form the core with pear and yellow melon on the fringes of this stainless steel Chardonnay from Lompoc's Kenneth “Joey” Gummere.

US,Zinfandel,86,15,OZV 2008 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),Virginie Boone,"A strongly briary old vine Zin from Lodi that's strangely restrained, with a taste of just-ripe blackberries that delves into bacon fat and mocha before falling off a tad at the finish.

US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,53,Sno Road 2009 Echo West Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (OR)),Paul Gregutt,"Quite dark, smoky and well along the path to full maturity, the fruit in this single-vineyard Cab is initially overshadowed completely by scents of charred wood. The soft cherry fruit seems wrapped—indeed soaked—in barrel flavors.

US,Chardonnay,88,30,Raptor Ridge 2015 Gran Moraine Vineyard Chardonnay,Paul Gregutt,"This barrel-fermented wine is a most pleasant quaffer. A mix of yellow apple and pink grapefruit flavors, along with some skin phenolics, power on through.

Spain,Tempranillo,85,120,Resalte 2001 Gran Resalte  (Ribera del Duero),Michael Schachner,"With Ribera wines there's an assumption of tannic presence, but this older vintage, while displaying a classy bouquet, is brutally tannic, with an acid-washed palate.

Italy,Nebbiolo,90,102,Luigi Oddero & Figli 2009 Rocche Rivera  (Barolo),Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of pressed rose, dried berry, leather, chopped herb, cinnamon and a balsamic note emerge in the glass.

France,Gamay,89,22,Château de Juliénas 2014 Cuvée Tradition  (Juliénas),Roger Voss,"Aged in large oak barrels, the wine is soft and fruity. It has juicy red cherry and red-berry fruits that give the wine a crisp, bright and lively character. The wood aging and the tannins fill the wine out bringing spice and a touch of vanilla. At the end, it is acidity that promises some aging. Drink from late 2017.",2014
Argentina,Malbec,91,90,Trapiche 2004 Manos Malbec (Mendoza),Michael Schachner,"A very rich and soft wine made from hand-squeezed Malbec grapes. There's a ton of oak on it, which comes out as coconut and cream on the nose. The palate is also creamy, with mocha, sweet blackberry and fudge flavors.

US,Petite Sirah,89,45,David Fulton 2009 Estate Bottled Petite Sirah (St. Helena),NA,"There's a richness to this wine that's immensely pleasurable, but also a meaty, umami spiciness.

Spain,White Blend,88,15,Viña Costeira 2009 White (Ribeiro),Michael Schachner,"A clean, dry, green-fruited wine that's juicy, citric, tangy and features pure orange, lemon and lime aromas and flavors.

US,Red Blend,88,20,Stemilt Creek 2004 Stemilt Hill Red Wine Red (Washington),Paul Gregutt,"This is very well made, smooth and supple.

New Zealand,Chardonnay,89,34,Kumeu River 2012 Estate Chardonnay (Kumeu),Joe Czerwinski,"Kumeu River is one of New Zealand's most consistent producers of Chardonnay.

US,Red Blend,90,75,DeLille 2007 Harrison Hill Red (Snipes Mountain),Paul Gregutt,"From a single vineyard on Snipes Mountain, this is a forceful, dark and liquorous version of Harrison Hill, which often carries more herbal accents.

Chile,Pinot Noir,86,14,Millaman 2014 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),Michael Schachner,"Briny cherry and red-currant aromas are light. This feels sharp on the palate, with fresh flavors of red plum, tomato and a salty hint.",2014

Iijima,"From it's musky, perfumed to nose to it's intensely honeyed, dried-peach- and apricot-flavored palate, everything about this wine is mysterious and ethereal. Crafted by monks in an ancient Georgian monastery, this amber-hued wine is made from white grapes that were fermented and aged in clay vessels (qvevri) and that underwent extended skin contact, which resulted in a wine with puckering tannins and a richly textural mouthfeel.",2010
Portugal,Alicante Bouschet,90,13,Fiuza 2012 Premium Alicante Bouschet (Tejo),Roger Voss,"Firmly tannic, it's based entirely on the rich structure of Alicante Bouschet.

France,Chenin Blanc,93,NA,Domaine des Baumard 2010  Savennières,Roger Voss,"This is perfectly balanced dry Chenin. It has just the right amount of richness, aided by a touch of vanilla.

Screwcap.",2010

Austria,Riesling,92,28,Arndorfer 2014 Strasser Weinberge Riesling (Niederösterreich),Anne Krebiehl MW,"Glorious perfume emanates from the nose, suggesting that cologne-like blend of citrus with far more mellow notes of musk and pine.

US,Syrah,86,52,Bergevin Lane 2008 Francisca's Vineyard Princess Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Paul Gregutt,"At the moment the pleasant fruit seems completely overmatched by the heavily charred, smoky barrel flavors.

US,Pinot Noir,93,60,Shea 2013 Block 23 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Paul Gregutt,"Block 23 is all Pommard clone. At first the drying, tea-flavored tannins push the fruit down, but over many hours the wine expands with generous flavors of cherry fruit leather, candied orange peel, and polished tannins.",2013
France,Syrah,82,23,M. Chapoutier 2001 Petite Ruche  (Crozes-Hermitage),Michael Schachner,"Green pepper and tobacco aromas signal some of the sour fruit that appears on the palate. Tastes of beets and pie cherries and an oaky, disparate finish doesn't do much to shape things up. Too sour and scattered.",2001
France,Pinot Noir,82,10,Gabriel Meffre 2016 La Châsse Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Roger Voss,"This is a thin, fruity, simple wine with some red cherry flavors. Acidity and a touch of tannin completes the picture.",2016
US,Rosé,89,18,Naughty Boy 2014 Floyd and Eddie Dry Rosé (Mendocino),Jim Gordon,"This barrel-fermented wine has a bright pink color, with exuberant peach and citrus aromas. Light cherry and peach flavors meet a tangy mouth-watering texture.",2014
US,Mourvèdre,93,42,Gramercy 2012 L'Idiot du Village Mourvèdre (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sean P. Sullivan,"This is an outrageously appealing wine with aromas of smoke, dried herbs and abundant peppery spices. It's sensuous and layered in feel, with generous dark fruit and black pepper flavors. It shows a profound sense of elegance, purity and detail with a finish that seems unending—a complete knee buckler.",2012
France,Rosé,88,20,Fabre en Provence 2016 Château de la Clapière Rosé (Côtes de Provence),Roger Voss,This wine comes from one of Côtes de Provence historic cru classé estates. It is a ripe and smooth wine with crisp acidity and a fine bite of spice. The wine is packed with red fruits and finished with refreshing acidity.,2016
Portugal,Portuguese Sparkling,89,NA,Borges 2004 Real Senhor Velha Reserva Sparkling (Vinho Espumante de Qualidade),Roger Voss,"A wine with good richness and weight, the crisp fruit softening into a more mature character, but still retaining a bright, tight acidity. It has good weight and would work well with food.",2004
US,Merlot,83,15,Tangley Oaks 2006 Lot #8 Merlot (Napa Valley),NA,"This Merlot has less than ripe green mint flavors along with the cherries and oak. It's fully dry, with a nice acid-tannin balance.",2006
