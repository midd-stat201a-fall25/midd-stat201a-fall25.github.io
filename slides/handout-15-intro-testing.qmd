### Practice in defining hypotheses

For each of the following, determine whether it represents a null hypothesis claim or an alternative hypothesis claim:

1.  King cheetahs on average run the same speed as standard spotted cheetahs.

\vspace{1cm}

2.  For a particular student, the probability of correctly answer a 5-option multiple choice test is larger than 0.2 (i.e. better than guessing)

3.  The probability of getting in a car accident is the same if using a cell phone then if not using a cell phone.

4.  The number of hours that grade-school children spend doing homework predicts their future success on standardized tests.

Write out the null and alternative hypotheses in words and also in statistical notation for each of the following situations:

1.  New York is known as "the city that never sleeps''. A random sample of 25 New Yorkers were asked how much they sleep they get per night. Does these data providing convincing evidence that New Yorkers on average sleep less than 8 hours per night? 

\vspace{2.5cm}

2.  A study suggests that 25% of 25 year-olds have gotten married. You believe that this is incorrect and decide to conduct your own analysis.

#### Hypotheses, significance level, and data (steps 1 and 2)

$H_{A}:$

$\alpha=$

The following is our data:

```{r}
x <- c(rep(1, 7), rep(0, 13)) 
p_hat <- mean(x)
```

#### Simulating under the null (step 3)

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: true
set.seed(2) 
B <- 5000 
n <- length(x) 
null_props <- rep(NA, B) 
for(b in 1:B){
  null_samp <- sample(x = c("pink", "purple"), 
                      size = n,
                      replace = T, 
                      prob = c(0.5, 0.5))
  null_props[b] <- sum(null_samp == "pink")/n
}
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

Visualize the null distribution of $\hat{p}$:

```{r echo = F, fig.height=2.75}
null_dist <- data.frame(p_null = null_props) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = p_null)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05,col = "white")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,0.1)) +
  labs(x = "Sample proportion drink coffee", title = "Null distribution",
       caption = "pink line = observed sample proportion") 
null_dist 

```
