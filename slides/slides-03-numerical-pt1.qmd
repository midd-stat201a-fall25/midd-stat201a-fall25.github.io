## Variables types

-   Variables can be broadly broken into two categories: numerical (quantitative) or categorical (qualitative)

-   **Numerical** variables take a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add/subtract/do mathematical operations with those values. Two types:

    1.  **Discrete** if it can only take on finitely many numerical values within a given interval

    2.  **Continuous** if it can take on any infinitely many values within a given interval

-   **Categorical** variables are essentially everything else (more on this next week!)

-   Examples and non-examples?

## Example

We will be looking at some medical insurance data throughout these slides.

::: discuss
Which of the following variables are numerical? Which are discrete vs. continuous?
:::

```{r}
insurance <- read_csv("data/insurance.csv") 
insurance |>
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5))

```

# Summary statistics for numerical data

## Condensing information

-   We often care about variable's **distribution**: the different values the variable can take on along with how often

-   Rather than provide someone with an entire dataset, it is more useful to provide quick "snapshot" information

-   Two pieces of quantitative information that describe a distribution:

    -   Center

    -   Spread

## Mean

-   Most common way to measure the center of the distribution of a numerical variable is using the **mean** (also called the **average**)

-   ***Sample*** **mean**: a mean calculated using sampled data. The sample mean is typically denoted as $\bar{x}$

    -   $x$ is a placeholder for the variable of interest (e.g. `BMI`, `charges`)
    -   The bar communicates that we are looking at the average

-   The sample mean is the sum over all the observed values of the variable, divided by total number of observations $n$:

::: fragment
$$\bar{x} = \frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + \ldots x_{n}}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$$
:::

## Mean (cont.)

-   The sample mean $\bar{x}$ is an example of a sample statistic

-   The mean over the entire population is an example of a population parameter. The **population mean** is denoted $\mu$ (Greek letter mu)

    -   The sample mean $\bar{x}$ is often used as an estimate for $\mu$ (more on this in a few weeks!)

## Examples

-   Let's calculate the sample mean weight of a piece of candy in our bag. Let $x$ be the weight of a candy.

    -   ::: discuss
        Calculate your $\bar{x}$
        :::

    -   **Note**: we did not need individual values $x_{1}, x_{2},\ldots$ to calculate $\bar{x}$!

-   Can we obtain the population mean?

    -   $\mu=$

:::: fragment
::: discuss
-   What is the average of the following values? $\qquad 1, 4, 4$

-   If instead there were ten 1's and twenty 4's, would the average be the same?

-   Thus, we see that means depend on proportions!
:::

## Variability

-   At the heart of statistics is also the **variability** or spread of the distribution of the variable

-   We will work with variance and standard deviation, which are ways to describe how spread out data are *from their mean*

::: fragment
```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
set.seed(10)
n <- 100
x <- seq(-5,5,0.01)
y1 <- dnorm(x, 0, 0.25)
y2 <- dnorm(x, 0, 1.25)
data.frame(x = x, data1 = y1, data2 = y2) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:3, names_to = "variable", values_to = "density") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=x, y = density)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~variable) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL)+
  geom_vline(xintercept =  0, col = "orange", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  plot_theme
```
:::

## Deviation

We begin with **deviation**, which is the distance or difference between an observation from the (sample) mean

-   How might we write this using statistical notation?
-   Let's write out the deviations of your five sampled weights

## Variance and standard deviation

-   The **sample variance** $s^2$ squares the deviations and takes an average:

    $$
    s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^2
    $$

    -   Let's talk about this notation and intuition behind this formula. In particular, there are at least two things to note

-   ::: discuss
    Set-up the calculation of the sample variance of your sample
    :::

    -   I will calculate this in `R`

-   The **sample standard deviation** $s$ is the simply the square root of the sample variance ($s = \sqrt{s^2}$)

## Variance and standard deviation (cont.)

-   Like the mean, the population values for variance and standard deviation are denoted with Greek letters:

    -   $\sigma$ for population standard deviation (Greek letter "sigma")

    -   $\sigma^2$ for population variance

-   ::: discuss
    If the calculation of standard deviation is a more complicated quantity than the variance, why do we bother with standard deviation?
    :::

## Live code

Functions to calculate sample mean, variance, and standard deviation in `R`. Each expects a vector of numerical values as input:

::: nonincremental
-   `mean()`

-   `var()`

# Visualizing numerical data

## Scatterplots

**Scatterplots** are *bivariate* (two-variable) visualizations that provide a case-by-case view of the data for two numerical variables

-   Each point represents the observed pair of values of variables 1 and 2 for a case in the dataset

::: fragment
```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
insurance |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = charges))+
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  ylab("Charges ($)") +
  xlab("Body mass index")  +
  plot_theme
```
:::

## Scatterplots (cont.)

-   How do we determine which variable to put on each axis?

-   What do scatterplots reveal about the data, and how are they useful?

::: notes
Associations/patterns (linear, exponential, etc) between two variables. They might not tell the complete story, however!

Positive vs negative associations
:::

## Visualizing univariate numerical data

-   To visualize the distribution (i.e. behavior) of a single variable, we could create a dot plot where:

    -   Each case is plotted on a horizontal axis as a dot

    -   Values that appear multiple times in the dataset would have stacked dots

-   ::: discuss
    Pros and cons?
    :::

-   In the following, we have a dot plot of `BMI` rounded to the nearest integer.

## Binning

-   We will sacrifice precision for convenience by *binning:*
    -   Segment the variable into equal-sized bins
    -   Visualize the value of each observation using its corresponding bin
-   For example, the `bmi` variable has observed values of $15.96$ through $49.6$. Consider the following bins of size 5: \[15, 19), \[19, 23), \[23, 27), ..., \[49, 53)
    -   Convention of left or right inclusive?
-   We tabulate/count up the number of observations that fall into each bin.

## Histograms

**Histograms** are visualizations that display the binned counts as bars for each bin.

-   Histograms provide a view of the **density** of the data (the values the data take on as well as how often)

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="30%"}
::: fragment
```{r}
insurance |>
  mutate(bmi_bin = case_when( bmi < 19 ~ "[15, 19)",
                    bmi >= 19 & bmi < 23 ~ "[19, 23)",
                    bmi >= 23 & bmi < 27 ~ "[23, 27)",
                    bmi >= 27 & bmi < 31 ~ "[27, 31)",
                    bmi >= 31 & bmi < 35 ~ "[31, 35)",
                    bmi >= 35 & bmi < 39 ~ "[35, 39)",
                    bmi >= 39 & bmi < 43 ~ "[39, 43)",
                    bmi >= 43 & bmi < 49 ~ "[43, 49)",
                    bmi >= 49 & bmi < 53 ~ "[49, 52)")) |>
  count(bmi_bin, name = "count") |>
  kableExtra::kable()

```

:::: {.column width="70%"}
::: fragment
```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
insurance |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram(breaks = seq(15, 53, 4), col = "white") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 50, 5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 60, 10)) +
  xlab("Body mass index") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 24))

## Describing distributions

A convenient way to describe a variable's behavior is through the ***shape*** of its distribution. Using histograms, we should identify:

1.  **Skewness** (or lack thereof):
    -   Distributions with long tails to the left are called **left-skewed**
    -   Distributions with long tails to the right are **right-skewed**
    -   If not skewed, then the distribution is **symmetric**
2.  **Modes**: prominent peaks in the distribution
    -   Distribution may be **unimodal** (one peak), **bimodal** (two peaks), or **multimodal** (more than two peaks)
    -   Peaks need not be same height

## Histograms (cont.)

::: discuss
How would you describe the shape (i.e. skewness and modality) of the distributions in the following two histograms?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="\"50%"}
```{r fig.height=8}
insurance |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram(breaks = seq(15, 53, 4)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 50, 5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 60, 10)) +
  xlab("Body mass index") +
  theme(text=element_text(size = 30))
```
:::

::: {.column width="\"50%"}
```{r fig.height=8}
insurance |>
  ggplot(aes(x = charges)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2500) +
  xlab("Charges ($)") +
  theme(text=element_text(size = 30))
```

## Creating visualizations

Working in your groups:

::: nonincremental
1.  Using a histogram, visualize the distribution of the sample mean weights from our activity
2.  Convince yourselves as a group: what is does a case represent in this data?
3.  Describe the shape of your distribution (i.e. skewness and modality)
4.  Obtain the sample mean and standard deviation of the sample means
