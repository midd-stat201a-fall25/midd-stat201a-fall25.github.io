A `.qmd` document in the Source pane might look like the following:

**What is the major difference between running code in an `.qmd` document in the Source pane versus running code in the Console?**

-   All code gets run/executed in the Console

-   The Source pane is simply a text editor: you can write and save code here to edit later. When you run code in the Source pane, it actually gets executed in the Console.

    -   In this course, we will almost always write our code in the Source pane within a `.Rmd` document.

    -   Code run in the Console will be "lost" whenever you quit RStudio.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **working directory** is the default location where R will look for files you want to load and where it will put any files you save. All files are read in relation to the current working directory!

-   Where can we see the current working directory?

-   What if we want to change the working directory?
