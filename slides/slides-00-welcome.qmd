## Important course information

-   Professor Becky Tang

    -   Office: Warner 214
    -   Email: btang\@middlebury.edu
    -   Office hours: Mondays 2-3pm, Fridays 10-11am

-   Course website: [https://midd-stat201-spring2025.github.io/](https://midd-stat201-fall2024.github.io/){.uri}

    -   Please bookmark this page and visit frequently!

## What is this course about?

-   What is statistics? What is data science?

-   By the end of this course, you will:

    -   Produce and interpret graphical displays and numerical summaries of data
    -   Have developed confidence and some proficiency in coding in `R` (and in particular, the tidyverse syntax)
    -   Better understand the central role of randomness in designing studies and making conclusions
    -   Hopefully want to pursue another Statistics or Mathematics course!
    -   And much more...

## Necessary background

-   We assume zero background in statistics and data science

-   There is a large computing component, though not as much as in STAT 118

    -   Comfort in typing on keyboard, navigating your file system

-   MATH 121 (Calculus 1) pre-req

## Recommendations

-   Takes notes! Each day's slides will be made available on the course website by 10pm the night before. I recommend either:

    -   Printing out the PDF version of slides to write notes on during class

        -   I recommend 4 or 6 slides per page (demo)

    -   Downloading PDF of slides to iPad/tablet/laptop and write notes on then using device

    -   Taking supplemental notes on paper/device

-   Re–visit notes within 24 hours of class

## Recommendations (cont.)

-   We will frequently make use of our laptops. Please bring one with enough charge to last the entire class each day we meet!

    -   **Please let me know as soon as possible if you do not have access to a laptop**

-   Try to resist the temptation to do other tasks (e.g. check email, online shop, watch shows) when your laptop is open

    -   This can be distracting to those around you

-   Keep an open mind and don't be afraid to ask for assistance or tell me to slow down!

-   Resist the temptation of using ChatGPT or other generative AI tools

## First assignment + submission

-   **Problem Set 0**: answers to a brief questionnaire are due before next class. See the course Schedule page for details!

-   All coding practice and homework assignments will be submitted to Gradescope via Canvas. You should all be able to access your Gradescope account using your Middlebury College credentials.

    -   On Canvas, assignments can be found in both the Assignment tab and the Gradescope tab

    -   Submissions can be resubmitted as many times as you like up until the due date

    -   We will walk through how to submit an assignment together, but instructions + video can also be found [here](https://guides.gradescope.com/hc/en-us/articles/21864315441677-Submitting-a-PDF-for-an-assignment)

## Example

Counties of the U.S. within the **bottom 10%** of death rates for kidney cancer for white males, 1980-1989.

# Key terminology

## Population and samples

-   Data do not come from thin air! Data have to be *collected* in some way.

-   This usually takes the form of sampling a subset of individuals from a target group of interest

    -   The target group of interest is called the **population**
    -   The subset of individuals from whom we actually collect data is the **sample**

-   A **case** is a fancy term for saying one observational *unit*

    -   In the kidney cancer example, the cases are counties

-   ::: discuss
    What are the target populations and cases in the following?

    1.  What is the average height of trees on Middlebury College campus?

    2.  What proportion of current Middlebury professors attended a liberal arts college?

    3.  Over the last five years, what is the average time to complete a degree for Middlebury students?
    :::

## Population and samples (cont.)

-   Typically, the size of the sample is way smaller than the population. Why?
    -   In the lucky event that we are able to collect data for every individual in the population, the sample is referred to as a **census**
-   Example: the U.S. Census Bureau is responsible for producing data about the American people and economy. They collect data with different schemes and frequency:
    -   [Decennial census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html)
    -   [American community survey](https://www.census.gov/history/www/programs/demographic/american_community_survey.html#:~:text=The%20survey%20provides%20current%20data,than%20once%20every%20five%20years.)

## Parameters and statistics

-   Often times, answering a research question simplifies to understanding a numerical summary.

    -   **(Population) parameter**: a numerical summary calculated from (or considered for calculation from) the entire population

    -   **(Sample) statistic**: a numerical summary calculated from a sample

-   Why do we differentiate? It's always good to remember that we are trying to answer questions about the population!

-   In kidney cancer data, we might want to know a county's *true* kidney cancer rate (for white males, 1980-1989)

    -   This would be an example of a population parameter

    -   Unless all white males in the county responded, the reported rate is an example of a sample statistic

## Beyoncé's albums

-   Beyoncé is one of the most famous singers of the 21st century

-   By 2023, Beyoncé had produced eight solo studio albums:

    -   *Dangerously in Love* (2003), *B'Day* (2006), *I Am... Sasha Fierce* (2008), *4* (2011), *Beyoncé* (2013), *Lemonade* (2016), *Renaissance* (2022)

    -   Popular opinion (i.e. Reddit) is that *Lemonade* is her best album

-   Is there any difference between the first four albums and *Lemonade*?

-   Let's consider the *average* length of words in these albums

    -   We will discuss "average" in more detail next week, but for today, we will treat "average" as a number that is calculated by summing a bunch of quantities together and dividing by the total number of quantities

## Average word length

```{r echo = F}
words <- beyonce |>
  unnest_tokens(output = word_all, input = lyric) |>
  mutate(word = str_replace_all(word_all, "[[:punct:]]", ""))  |>
  mutate(length = str_length(word)) |>
  # anti_join(stop_words) |>
  select(album, year, line, track_title, word, length) 
avg_length_true <- words |>
  filter(year < 2018) |>
  # group_by(album, year) |>
  summarise(avg_length = mean(length))
avg_length_lemonade_true <- words |>
  filter(album =="Lemonade") |>
  # group_by(album, year) |>
  summarise(avg_length = mean(length))
```

The average length of a word in Beyoncé's first four alums is `r round(avg_length_true, 2)`. What is the average length of a word in *Lemonade*?
