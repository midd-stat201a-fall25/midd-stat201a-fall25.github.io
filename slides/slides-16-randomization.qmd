## Where we're going today

-   We will see another kinds of hypotheses for different types of research questions

-   Hypothesis testing framework is the same, but will change how we obtain null distribution

-   Try to see the big picture

# Test of independence

## Running example: sex discrimination study

-   Note: this study considered sex as binary "male" or "female", and did not take into consideration gender identities

-   Participants in the study were 48 bank supervisors who identified as male and were attending a management institute at UNC in 1972

    -   Each supervisor was asked to assume the role of personnel director of a bank

    -   Each given a file to judge whether the person in the file should be promoted

    -   The files were identical, except half of them indicated that the candidate was male, and the other half were indicated as female

    -   Files were randomly assigned to bank managers

Research question: Are individuals who identify their sex as female discriminated against in promotion decisions made by their managers who identify as male?
:::

-   ::: discuss
    What is/are the variables(s) here? What types of variables are they?
    :::

-   We need to construct hypotheses where $H_{0}$ is "status quo" and $H_{A}$ is the claim researchers have

-   $H_{0}$: the variables `sex` and `decision` are independent.

    -   i.e. any observed difference in promotion rates is due to variability

-   $H_{A}$: the variables `sex` and `decision` are *not* independent, and equally-qualified female personnel are less likely to be promoted than male personnel

## Data

For each of the 48 supervisors, the following were recorded:

-   The sex of the candidate in the file (male/female)

-   The decision (promote/not promote)

::: fragment
```{r}
set.seed(1)
sex <- c(rep("male", 24), rep('female', 24))
decision <- c(rep("promote", 21), rep("not promote", 3), rep("promote", 14), rep("not promote", 10))
discrimination <- data.frame(sex, decision)  |>
  sample_frac()

ct <- discrimination |>
  group_by(sex, decision) |>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  spread(decision, n) |>
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(total = `not promote`+ promote)

ct <- ct |>
  rbind(c("total", colSums(ct[-1])))

ct <- ct |> 
  kable() |>
  column_spec(1, border_right = T)
ct
```
:::

::: discuss
-   What evidence do we have? What summary statistic(s) would be useful for answering the research question?
:::

## Data (cont.)

Conditional probability of getting promoted by sex:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo = T, eval = T}
# look at data
discrimination |>
  slice(1:4)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo = T, eval = F}
discrimination |>
  count(sex, decision) |>
  group_by(sex) |>
  mutate(cond_prob = n/sum(n)) |>
  filter(decision == "promote") |>
  select(-n)
```
:::
:::::

```{r}
props <- discrimination |>
  count(sex, decision) |>
  group_by(sex) |>
  mutate(cond_prob = n/sum(n)) |>
  filter(decision == "promote") |>
  select(-n)
p_f <- props |>
  filter(sex == "female") |>
  pull(cond_prob)
p_m <- props |>
  filter(sex == "male") |>
  pull(cond_prob)
props |>
  kable(digits = 3)
```

-   Is the observed difference $\hat{p}_{f,obs} - \hat{p}_{m,obs} =$ `r p_f - p_m` **convincing evidence**? We need to examine variability in the data, assuming $H_{0}$ true.

-   Let's set $\alpha = 0.05$

## Simulate under null

-   Simulating under $H_{0}$ means operating in a hypothetical word where `sex` and `decision` are independent.

    -   This means that knowing the `sex` of the candidate should have no bearing on the `decision` to promote or not

-   We will perform a simulation called a **randomization test**:

    -   **Randomly** pair up `decision` and `sex` outcome pairs

    -   Randomly assigning a decision to each person would be equivalent to a world in which the bankers' `decision` had been independent of candidate's `sex` (i.e. if $H_{0}$ true)

## Randomization test

```{r}
ct
```

-   Write down "promote" on `r sum(decision == "promote")` cards and "not promote" on `r sum(decision == "not promote")` cards. Repeat the following:

    -   Thoroughly shuffle these `r length(decision)` cards.

    -   Deal out a stack of `r sum(sex == "male")` cards to represent males, and the remaining `r sum(sex == "female")` cards to represent females

        -   This is how we simulate under $H_{0}$

    -   Calculate the proportion of "promote" cards in each stack, $\hat{p}_{f, sim}$ and $\hat{p}_{m, sim}$

    -   Calculate and record the difference $\hat{p}_{f,sim} - \hat{p}_{m,sim}$ (order of difference doesn't matter so long as you are consistent)

## Randomization test (activity)

Try it!

## Randomization test (code)

n_f <- sum(discrimination$sex == "female")
n_m <- sum(discrimination$sex == "male")

B <- 1000
diff_props_null <- rep(NA, B)
for(b in 1:B){
  shuffled <- sample(decisions, n)
  rand_f <- shuffled[1:n_f]
  rand_m <- shuffled[-c(1:n_f)]
  
  p_f_sim <-  mean(rand_f == "promote")
  p_m_sim <-mean(rand_m == "promote")
  
  diff_props_null[b] <- p_f_sim - p_m_sim
}
```

::: discuss
-   Where should the null distribution be centered?
:::

## Null distribution

```{r fig.height=8}
null_dist <- data.frame(prop_diff = diff_props_null)|>
  mutate(extreme = prop_diff <= (p_f - p_m))
null_dist |>
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_diff)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, col = "white") +
  labs(x = "Difference in promotion rates (female - male)",
       title = "Null distribution") +
  theme(text = element_text(size= 24))
p_val <- mean(null_dist$extreme)
```

## Obtain p-value

Recall, the observed difference in our data was $\hat{p}_{f,obs} - \hat{p}_{m,obs} =$ `r p_f - p_m`.

-   p-value is probability of observing data as or more extreme than our original data, given $H_{0}$ true.

-   ::: discuss
    Where does "as or more extreme" correspond to on our plot?
    :::

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: fragment
```{r fig.height = 6.2}
null_dist |>
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_diff, fill = extreme)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, col = "white") +
  labs(x = "Difference in promotion rates (female - male)", title = "Null dist.",
       caption = "magenta line denotes observed difference") +
  theme(text = element_text(size= 24)) +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey30", "magenta")) +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = p_f - p_m, col = "magenta",linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 2) 
```
:::
::::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Out of `r B` simulations under $H_{0}$, `r sum(null_dist$extreme)` resulted in a difference in promotion rates as or more extreme than our observed
-   So the p-value is approximately `r p_val`
:::
::::::

## Making decision and conclusion

Our research question: Are individuals who identify their sex as female discriminated against in promotion decisions made by their managers who identify as male?

-   $H_{0}$: `sex` and `decision` are independent
-   $H_{A}$: `sex` and `decision` are not independent and equally-qualified female personnel are less likely to get promoted than male personnel by male supervisors
-   $\alpha = 0.05$

::: discuss
-   Interpret our p-value in context.

-   Make a decision and conclusion in response to the research question.
:::

## Making decision and conclusion (answer)

-   **p-value interpretation**: Assuming that `sex` and `decision` are independent, the probability of observing a difference in promotion rates as or more extreme as `r p_f - p_m` is `r p_val`.

-   **Decision**: Because the observed p-value of `r p_val` is less than our significant level 0.05, we reject $H_{0}$.

-   **Conclusion**: The data provide strong evidence of sex discrimination against female candidates by the male supervisors.

# Difference in two proportions

## Running example: CPR (openintro)

-   An experiment was conducted, consisting of two treatments on 90 patients who underwent CPR for a heart attack and subsequently went to the hospital. Each patient was randomly assigned to either:

    -   treatment group: received a blood thinner
    -   control group: did not receive a blood thinner

-   For each patient, the outcome recorded was whether they survived for at least 24 hours.

-   ::: discuss
    What is/are the variables(s) here? What types of variables are they?
    :::

## Defining hypotheses

The researchers are interested in learning if the blood thinner treatment was effective for patients who undergo CPR after a heart attack?

-   $H_{0}:$ the blood thinner treatment was not effective

-   $H_{A}:$ the blood thinner treatment was effective

:::: fragment
::: discuss
Try to write down the hypotheses using statistical notation.
:::
::::

-   Let $p_{T}$ and $p_{C}$ denote the proportion of patients who survive when receiving the thinner (Treatment) and when not receiving the treatment (Control), respectively

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
Option 1

-   $H_{0}$: $p_{T} = p_{C}$

-   $H_{A}$: $p_{T} > p_{C}$
:::
::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
Option 2 (preferred)

-   $H_{0}$: $p_{T} - p_{C} = 0$

-   $H_{A}$: $p_{T} - p_{C}> 0$
:::

## Collect data

Using the data, obtain the observed difference in sample proportions.

:::::: columns

::: fragment
```{r echo = T}
# pull() takes a column from data frame and turns into vector
p_hat_c <- cpr |>

-   $\hat{p}_{C, obs} = \frac{`r counts |> filter(group == "control", outcome == "survived") |> pull(n)`}{`r counts |> filter(group == "control") |> pull(n) |> sum()`} = `r p_hat_c`$

-   $\hat{p}_{T,obs} = \frac{`r counts |> filter(group == "treatment", outcome == "survived") |> pull(n)`}{`r counts |> filter(group == "treatment") |> pull(n) |> sum()`} = `r p_hat_t`$

-   Observed difference: $\hat{p}_{T,obs} - \hat{p}_{C,obs} = `r obs_diff`$
:::
::::::

-   Is this "convincing evidence" that blood thinner usage after CPR is effective?

-   Set $\alpha = 0.05$

## Simulate under null

-   We will once again perform a *randomization* test to try and simulate the difference in proportions under $H_{0}$

    -   Under $H_{0}$, treatment group is no better than control group, so let's simulate assuming that outcome and treatment are independent

::: discuss
-   Try filling out worksheet!
:::

-   Write down `died` on `r sum(cpr$outcome == "died")` cards, and `survived` on `r sum(cpr$outcome == "survived")` cards. Then repeat several times:

    -   Shuffle cards well

    -   Deal out `r sum(cpr$group == "control")` to be Control group, and remaining `r sum(cpr$group == "treatment")` to be Treatment group

    -   Calculate proportions of survival $\hat{p}_{C, sim}$ and $\hat{p}_{T, sim}$

    -   Obtain and record the simulated difference $\hat{p}_{T, sim} - \hat{p}_{C, sim}$

## Simulate under null (code)

Live code or look here:

```{r echo = T}
set.seed(310)
n_t <- sum(cpr$group == "treatment")
n_c <- sum(cpr$group == "control")
cards <- cpr$outcome
B <- 1000
diff_props_null <- rep(NA , B)
for(b in 1:B){
  shuffled <- sample(cards)
  treat_sim <- shuffled[1:n_t]
  control_sim <- shuffled[-c(1:n_t)]
  
  p_t_sim <- mean(treat_sim == "survived")
  p_c_sim <- mean(control_sim == "survived")
  
  diff_props_null[b] <- p_t_sim - p_c_sim

n_extreme <- sum(diff_prop_null$extreme)
p_val <- round(mean(diff_prop_null$extreme), 3)
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   We simulated `r n_extreme` out of `r B` simulations where the difference in proportions under $H_{0}$ was as or more extreme than our observed difference of `r obs_diff`

-   So p-value is approximately `r p_val`
:::
:::::

## Interpret and make conclusion

The researchers are interested in learning if the blood thinner treatment was effective.

Our p-value is `r p_val`.

::: discuss
-   Make a decision and conclusion about the research question in context. What type of error could we have made?
:::

-   **Decision**: because our p-value of `r p_val` is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_{0}$

-   **Conclusion**: the data do not provide convincing evidence that the blood thinner treatment improves survival rates among patients who undergo CPR.

-   **Possible error**: Type 2

## Comprehension questions

-   What were the similarities and differences between:

    -   hypothesis test for independence

    -   hypothesis test for two proportions

-   How do the randomization tests today differ from the test for one proportion that we learned last class?
