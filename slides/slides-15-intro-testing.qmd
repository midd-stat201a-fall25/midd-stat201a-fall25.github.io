```{r echo = F, message= F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, warning = F, messabundance = F)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(kableExtra)
plot_theme <- theme(text = element_text(size = 24))

get_bootstrap <- function(x, n, B, stat){
  bootstrap_stats <- rep(NA, B)
  for(b in 1:B){
    # resample
    x_boot <- sample(x = x, size = n, replace = TRUE)
    # calculate and store bootstrap statistic

## Testing

We are now entering into second branch of inference-related tasks: testing.

-   We have some "claim"/question about the target population, and we use sampled data to provide evidence for or against the claim

    -   Especially important in medicine

-   We will use the *hypothesis testing framework* to formalize the process of making decisions about research claims.

    -   Because the claim is about target population, we will almost always formulate claims in terms of population parameters

    -   Then we use sampled data to provide the evidence for/against

## Hypothesis testing framework

Four stages (we will step through each one):

1.  Define your hypotheses
2.  Collect data, set a significance level
3.  Determine strength of evidence (null distribution, p-value)
4.  Make decision and conclusion in context

## Step 1: Define hypotheses

A **hypothesis test** is a statistical technique used to evaluate competing claims using data

-   We define hypotheses to translate our research question/claim into statistical notation

-   We always define two hypotheses *in context*: a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis

-   **Null hypothesis** $H_{0}$: hypothesis that represents "business as usual"/status quo/nothing unusual or noteworthy

-   **Alternative hypothesis** $H_{A}$: claim the researchers want to demonstrate

It will not always be obvious what the hypotheses should be, but you will develop intuition for this over time!

## Practice in defining hypotheses

For each of the following, determine whether it represents a null hypothesis claim or an alternative hypothesis claim:
:::

1.  King cheetahs on average run the same speed as standard spotted cheetahs.

2.  For a particular student, the probability of correctly answer a 5-option multiple choice test is larger than 0.2 (i.e. better than guessing)

3.  The probability of getting in a car accident is the same if using a cell phone then if not using a cell phone.

4.  The number of hours that grade-school children spend doing homework predicts their future success on standardized tests.

## Practice in defining hypotheses

For each of the following, determine whether it represents a null hypothesis claim or an alternative hypothesis claim:

1.  King cheetahs on average run the same speed as standard spotted cheetahs.

    -   Null!

2.  For a particular student, the probability of correctly answer a 5-option multiple choice test is larger than 0.2 (i.e. better than guessing)

    -   Alternative!

3.  The probability of getting in a car accident is the same if using a cell phone then if not using a cell phone.

    -   Null!

4.  The number of hours that grade-school children spend doing homework predicts their future success on standardized tests.

    -   Alternative!

## Practice in defining hypotheses

::: discuss
Write out the null and alternative hypotheses in words and also in statistical notation for the following situations:
:::

1.  New York is known as "the city that never sleeps''. A random sample of 25 New Yorkers were asked how much they sleep they get per night. Do these data providing convincing evidence that New Yorkers on average sleep less than 8 hours per night?

2.  A study suggests that 25% of 25 year-olds have gotten married. You believe that this is incorrect and decide to conduct your own analysis.

## Practice in defining hypotheses

New York is known as "the city that never sleeps''. A random sample of 25 New Yorkers were asked how much they sleep they get per night. Does these data providing convincing evidence that New Yorkers on average sleep less than 8 hours per night?

-   Words

    -   $H_0$: New Yorkers sleep an average of 8 hours per night
    -   $H_{A}:$ New Yorkers sleep an average of less than 8 hours per night

-   Notation: let $\mu$ be the average hours of sleep of New Yorkers

    -   $H_{0}: \mu = 8$
    -   $H_{A}:  \mu < 8$

## Practice in defining hypotheses

A study suggests that 25% of 25 year-olds in the US have gotten married. You believe that this is incorrect and decide to conduct your own analysis.

-   Words

    -   $H_0$: the proportion of 25 year-olds in the US who are married is 0.25
    -   $H_{A}:$ the proportion of 25 year-olds in the US who are married is not 0.25

-   Notation: let $p$ be the proportion of 25 year-olds in the US who are married

    -   $H_{0}: p = 0.25$
    -   $H_{A}:  p \neq 0.25$

## Defining hypotheses in context

**Research question**: do the minority of Middlebury students drink coffee regularly?

-   ::: discuss
    Try to write down our null and alternative hypotheses in statistical notation! This includes defining parameters!
    :::

    -   Define $p$ as the true proportion of Middlebury students who drink coffee regularly
    -   $H_{0}:\ p = 0.5$ versus $H_{A}:\ p < 0.5$

## Step 2: Collect and summarize data

```{r echo = F}
x <- c(rep(1, 7), rep(0, 13))
n <- length(x)
p_hat <- mean(x)
```

Our sample is the convenience sample I took of our class: `r x`, where 1 = "yes" and 0 = "no".

-   Point estimate: $\hat{p}_{obs} = `r round(p_hat,2)`$

-   ::: discuss
    Are we prepared to answer our research question based on this evidence?
    :::

-   NO! Due to variability, we should ask: do the data provide ***convincing evidence*** that the minority of Middlebury students drink coffee regularly?

## Step 3: Determine if we have "convincing evidence"

"Convincing evidence" for us means that it would be [highly unlikely]{.underline} to observe the data we did (or data even more extreme) ***if*** $H_{0}$ were true!

-   We will calculate a **p-value**: the probability of observing data as or more extreme than we did, *assuming* $H_{0}$ true

    -   Note: p in "p-value" is not the same as parameter $p$!

    -   This is a conditional probability: we condition on $H_{0}$ true

-   [Highly unlikely]{.underline} is vague and needs to defined by the researcher, ideally before seeing data.

    -   If we want to provide a yes/no answer to the research question, we need some threshold to compare the p-value to. This is called a **significance level** $\alpha$

    -   Common choices are $\alpha = 0.05$, $\alpha = 0.01$ (more on this later)!

-   For our example, we will choose $\alpha = 0.05$

## How to obtain p-value?

-   How to obtain this probability?

-   Need access to a distribution that corresponds to a world where $H_{0}$ is true (i.e. the **null distribution**)

    -   Option 1: if we have assumptions about how our data behave, we can obtain this distribution using theory/math (next week)

    -   Option 2: if we don't want to make assumptions, why not simulate?

        -   We will call this option "simulating under $H_{0}$"

-   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
    This is the step that requires the most "work", and what exactly you do will depend on the the type of data and the research question/claim you have
    :::

## Simulating under $H_{0}$ (step 3 cont.)

-   We have to simulate our data under the assumption that $H_{0}$ is true (recall $H_0$: $p = 0.5$)

-   Imagine a big bag filled with many slips of pink and purple slips of paper

    -   Pink = coffee-drinkers

    -   Purple = non-coffee-drinkers

::: discuss
-   **To simulate under** $H_{0}$, what proportion of the slips in the bag should be pink vs purple?
:::

-   To simulate under $H_{0}: p = 0.50$, half of the slips should be pink!

## Simulating under $H_{0}$ (step 3 cont.)

-   To simulate under $H_{0}$, we replicate our original sample, this time sampling from this "null world" bag of paper slips

    -   Repeatedly take samples from this null distribution using original sample size $n =$ `r n`

    -   For each sample, calculate the simulated proportion of pink slips

-   Live code?

::: fragment
```{r echo = T}
set.seed(2)
B <- 5000 
n <- length(x)
null_props <- rep(NA, B)
for(b in 1:B){
  null_samp <- sample(x = c("pink", "purple"), 
                      size = n,
                      replace = T,
                      prob = c(0.5, 0.5)) 
  null_props[b] <- sum(null_samp == "pink")/n
}
```
:::

## Null distribution of statistic

We can visualize the distribution of $\hat{p}$ assuming $H_{0}$ true:

```{r}
null_dist <- data.frame(p_null = null_props) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = p_null)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05,col = "white")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,0.1)) +
  labs(x = "Sample proportion drink coffee", title = "Null distribution") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25))
null_dist 
```

-   This is called the **null distribution** of the sample statistic, which is the distribution of the statistic $\hat{p}$ assuming $H_{0}$ is true

-   ::: discuss
    Where is this null distribution of $\hat{p}$ centered? Why does that "make sense"?
    :::

## Comparing null to observed

Let's return to our original goal of Step 3! We need to find the **p-value**: the probability of observing data as or more extreme as ours, assuming $H_{0}$ were true.

-   Our observed point estimate was $\hat{p}_{obs} =$ `r p_hat`

-   $H_{0}$: $p = 0.5$ and $H_{A}$: $p < 0.5$

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   ::: discuss
    What does "as or more extreme" mean in this context?

    How can we use the null distribution to obtain this probability?
    :::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
```{r fig.height=8}
null_dist +
  labs(title = "Null distribution",caption = "pink line = observed sample proportion") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = p_hat, col = "pink", linewidth = 2) +
  theme(text =element_text(size = 30))
```
:::
::::
::::::

## Obtain p-value (step 3 cont.)

We can directly estimate the p-value using our null distribution and our observed $\hat{p}$!

```{r}
data.frame(p_null = null_props) |>
  mutate(greater = p_null <= p_hat) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = p_null, fill = greater)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05,col = "white", alpha = 0.5)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,0.1)) +
  labs(x = "Sample proportion drink coffee") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25)) +
  labs(title = "Null distribution") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = p_hat, col = "pink", size = 2) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey30", "pink"))+
  guides(fill = "none")

p_val <- sum(null_props <= p_hat)/B
```

-   Out of `r B` replications, we saw `r sum(null_props <= p_hat)` instances of $\hat{p} \leq \hat{p}_{obs}$
-   p-value is $\frac{ `r sum(null_props <= p_hat)`}{`r B`} \approx$ `r round(p_val, 2)`

## Step 4: Interpret p-value and make decision

1.  Interpret the p-value `r p_val` in context

    -   ::: discuss
        Assuming $H_{0}$ true, the probability of observing a sample proportion as or more extreme as our `r p_hat` is approximately `r round(p_val, 2)`
        :::

2.  Make a decision about research claim/question by comparing p-value to significance level $\alpha$

    -   If p-value $< \alpha$, we *reject* $H_{0}$ (it was highly unlikely to observe our data given $H_{0}$ and our selected threshold)

    -   If p-value $\geq \alpha$, we *fail to reject* $H_{0}$ (not have enough evidence against the null)

        -   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
            Note: we never "accept $H_{A}$"!
            :::

    -   ::: discuss
        Since our p value is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_{0}$. The data do not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that the minority of Middlebury students drink coffee regularly.
        :::

## Summary of testing framework

Four steps for hypothesis test:

1.  Define null and alternative hypotheses $H_{0}$ and $H_{A}$ in context
2.  Collect data and set significance level $\alpha$
3.  Obtain the null distribution of the statistic and use it to obtain/estimate p-value
    -   We did this using by simulating
4.  Interpret p-value and make a decision in context

## Errors in decision

-   In Step 4, we make a decision but it could be wrong! (Unfortunately, we will never know)

-   We always fall into one of the following four scenarios:

    Identify which cells are good scenarios, and which are bad
    :::

## Errors in decision

![](figs/13-error_table_filled.png)

-   ::: discuss
    What kind of error could we have made in our example?
    :::

-   It is important to weight the consequences of making each type of error!

    -   We have some control in this - how? Through $\alpha$!

## Comprehension questions

-   What are the similarities/differences between the bootstrap distribution of a sample statistic and the simulated null distribution?

-   Do you understand what a p-value represents, and how we obtain it from the null distribution?

-   What role does $\alpha$ play? Why is it important to set $\alpha$ early on?
