# Sampling from a population

## Variables in statistics

::: discuss
What is a variable?
:::

::: notes
Variables in math represent a quantity that can change; not fixed. For us, it's the same idea! A variable is a characteristic/number/quantity that can be measured or counted and can take different values
:::

-   Lots of research questions revolve around asking how variable $x$ affects variable $y$

-   If $y$ is the primary variable of interest, i.e. the variable whose behavior we want to understand, it is called the **response variable**

-   If we try to understand how changing $x$ affects $y$, then $x$ is called the **explanatory variable**

    -   In scientific studies, explanatory variables can often be manipulated/controlled/observed by the researcher ahead of time

## A "good" sample

::: notes
Ask class: do you like statistics? Expect: response, non-response, and selection bias due to convenience sampling
:::

-   The way we sample data from a population can directly influence the quality of that sample.

-   ::: discuss
    What are desirable characteristics of a sample?
    :::

    -   **Representative**: the sample roughly "looks like" the population
        -   i.e. the characteristics of participants in the sample are similar to those of the population
    -   **Generalizable**: any results based on the sample can generalize to the population
        -   i.e. we can use results from a sample to draw conclusions about a specific population

## Bias in a sample

-   **Biased** samples occur when the methods used to obtain data result in inaccurate/skewed depictions of the population. This is bad!!

    -   Can occur if a sample is not representative

-   Bias in a sample can arise due to many causes. Here are just a few:

    -   **Selection bias**: systematic tendency in procedure that causes some members of population to be more likely to be included than others

    -   **Non-response bias**: the values of the response variable of non-respondents differ systematically from those that do respond

    -   **Response bias**: systematic favoring of certain response variable values that occurs when people don't answer truthfully (e.g. lying)

-   Any type of bias could lead to our sample being non representative or not generalizable

## Example: *Literary Digest* poll

-   1936 was an election year in the United States. Franklin D. Roosevelt (a Democrat) was completing his first term in office as president.

-   Republican candidate Alfred Landon of Kansas was his competitor

-   *Literary Digest* magazine conducted a polling survey, which received 2.4 million respondents (largest number of people every replying to a poll at that time)

    -   Prediction: overwhelming victory for Landon (predicted FDR would only get **43%** of popular vote)

-   Actual result: FDR won by a landslide! (**62%** to 38%)

-   What happened? Selection and non-response bias

::: notes
-   Selection bias: Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people. Where did they get the address form? Telephone books and club membership lists –\> screened out the poor (only about 25% of households had phones)

    -   This wouldn't necessarily be bias, EXCEPT for the fact that poor people overwhelmingly favored FDR and the rich favored Landon

-   Non-response bias: lots of people didn't respond to survey (\~75%)

    -   Once again, wouldn't matter if there wasn't a difference in the opinions of respondents vs non-respondents. But among the 25% who responded, over half favored Landon

    -   Non-respondents can be very different from respondents. When there is high non-response rate, look for non-response bias

-   Lesson: not all samples that were done poorly are necessarily biased, but we should always ask how the sample was conducted! Also, when a selection procedure is biased, a large sample does not help; this just replicates the mistake on a larger scale!

# Sampling methods

## Convenience sampling

The worst kind of sampling (but often the easiest)!

-   **Convenience sampling** takes place when cases that are easily accessible are more likely to be included in the sample

-   Example:

    -   Population: students enrolled in statistics courses at Middlebury

    -   Sample: students in STAT 201 AZ

## Probability sampling

-   In general, sampling methods that include a bit of randomness can help reduce the chance of bias

-   **Probability/random sampling**: any sampling method where the selection from the population is based on random selection/chance

    -   No one has full discretion about who is included in the sample

-   **Random sampling usually yields a representative and generalizable sample**

-   Examples include: simple random, stratified, cluster, systematic

## 1. Simple random sampling (SRS)

-   In a **simple random sample**, each case is chosen entirely by chance from the population, and each member of the population has an equal chance of being sampled

    -   Knowing that an individual was sampled does not provide useful information about which other cases are included

    -   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
        Any given fixed-size subset of the population is equally likely to be chosen
        :::

-   ::: discuss
    Consider again the research question: What proportion of current Middlebury professors attended a liberal arts college?

    How might I obtain a simple random sample of 25 professors?
    :::

::: notes
Requires us to list all of the units in the target/survey population --\> May be unrealistic!
:::

## 2. Stratified sampling

-   Assume that the population is/can be broken up into several different, distinct sub-populations or **strata**

    -   Cases grouped into a strata should be similar to each other

-   Then take a (simple) random sample from ***each*** stratum ("divide and conquer")

    -   How many from each stratum? Typically use a sampling fraction that is proportional to entire population!

    -   E.g. if population of trees on Middlebury campus are 80% deciduous and 20% coniferous and we want to sample $n = 10$ trees total, we should *randomly* sample \_\_\_ deciduous and \_\_\_ coniferous trees

-   What are some pros/cons?

::: notes
-   Depending on the population, we might need to use different random sampling methods to ensure the sample is representative

-   May be useful to ensure we have samples from rare groups, and helps to improve precision of the sample

-   Most useful when stratifying variables are simple to work with, easy to observe, closely related to topic of survey

-   Can be expensive to travel –\> motivates the next type

-   Analyzing data from stratified sampling usually requires a more complex approach (beyond our scope here)
:::

## 3. Cluster sampling

-   Divide total population into $M$ distinct groups or **clusters** of roughly equal size

-   Perform a (simple) random sample on the $M$ clusters, than sample all individuals within each of the randomly selected clusters

-   ::: discuss
    Discuss the following:

    -   Would you prefer the individuals within a cluster to be homogeneous (similar) or heterogeneous (varied)? Why?

    -   Would you prefer that cluster A and cluster B be relatively similar or different in terms of their sub-populations?

    -   What is the difference between stratified and cluster sampling?
    :::

::: notes
-   Creates pockets of sampled units –\> reducing costs. Also useful when we cannot obtain a list of ALL units in the population, but can easily obtain a list of all units within a cluster

-   Less efficient that SRS –\> better to survey large number of small clusters than vice versa

    -   Neighboring units tend to be more similar –\> sampling one being cluster would not represent a whole spectrum of variation present in the entire population

-   Difficult to control final sample size. If you want a particular size n (e.g. 100), the other two methods are easier
:::

# Types of studies

We now know *how* to collect data, but now we turn to examining what *kind* of study we'd like to perform in order to answer the research question.

## Experiments vs Observational studies

-   **Observational studies** occur when a research *observes* cases without manipulating any variables

-   **Experiments** are studies where the researcher *assigns* specific treatments to cases

    -   Note: experiments are often conducted in medical settings, hence the word "treatment"

-   Example: I want to design a study to learn if students who take quizzes throughout the semester end up performing better on the final exam.

    -   Observational study: students optionally take quizzes

    -   Experiment: I choose half of the students to take quizzes and the other half to not take quizzes.

-   ::: discuss
    Are treatments in experiments considered explanatory or response variables?
    :::

## Treatment vs control

-   Treatments are typically divided into two categories:

    1.  **Control group**: establishes a baseline, and typically receives "zero amount" of the explanatory variable

    2.  **Treatment group(s):** receive some "non-zero amount" of the explanatory variable

-   Quiz example continued:

    -   Control group: no quizzes

    -   Treatment group 1: takes one quiz

    -   Treatment group 2: takes two quizzes

    -   ::: discuss
        How to decide which case gets which treatment?
        :::

## Randomized experiments

-   When the researcher *randomly* assigns the treatments, we have a **randomized experiment**

    -   Randomized experiments are critical when trying to assess the causal effect of the explanatory variable on the response variable

-   **Note**: random assignment in experiments $\ne$ random sampling for participation in the sample

-   Continuing example:

    -   Randomized experiment is achieved if I use SRS to determine who received which treatment

    -   But the students who "participate" in the experiment were not obtained via SRS

## Confounding variables

-   Understanding a *causal* relationship is made difficult by **confounding** **variables**: variables that are associated with both the explanatory and response variable of interest

    -   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
        Confounders are bad!! Why?
        :::

-   Example: consider a study that seeks to examine the effect of coffee consumption on heart disease.

    -   From each person, we only collect information on the average amount of coffee they consume per day and whether or not they have heart disease.

    -   We find a positive association: more coffee $\rightarrow$ higher risk of heart disease

    -   Possible confounder: smoker status. Smokers [tend to drink more coffee](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4879503/#:~:text=Cigarette%20smoking%20is%20associated%20with,of%20coffee%20per%20day%202.) and tend to have [higher rates of heart disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7399440/) than non-smokers.

    -   So the increase in heart disease may be due to smoker status rather than caffeine intake

::: notes
Confounders prevent us from attributing the cause to the (desired) explanatory variable!
:::

## Principles of experimental design

1.  **Randomization**: randomly assign patients to treatments

    -   Helps account possible confounding variables

2.  **Controlling** **for differences** in the treatment: ensure that everyone follows the same protocol exactly

3.  **Replication**: the more cases we observe, the more confidence we have in the effect of the explanatory on the response

    -   Achieved by collecting a sufficiently large sample in a single study, or repeating the entire study more than once

## Reducing bias in human experiments

-   Biases can still unintentionally arise in experiments, even if we follow these three principles.

-   We should make the experiment a **blind experiment** by not allowing participants to know which group they've been assigned to

    -   Give a fake treatment known as a **placebo** to those in the control group (e.g. a sugar pill that looks exactly like the actual treatment pill)

    -   **Placebo effect:** a placebo results in a slight but real improvement in control patients

-   Doctors and researchers involved in the study should also be blinded so they do not give preferential treatment or care to patients in certain groups.

    -   **Double-blind** experiments: *both* the patients and the doctors/researchers who interact with patients are unaware of who is receive which treatment

## Reducing bias in human experiments (cont.)

Caveats:

-   Blinding not always possible! It would be hard to give a placebo in the quiz experiment

-   Question of ethics

## Observational studies

-   Causal conclusions ***cannot*** be obtained using data from observational studies

    -   There are too many confounding variables at play!

-   But they are much cheaper, and can be used to identify associations or form hypotheses for future experiments!
